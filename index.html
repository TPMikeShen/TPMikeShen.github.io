            <p>What is medicine?</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Medicine: Science? Human studies?</p>
<p>Section 1 examination of “medical registration”</p>
<p>Overemphasizing scientificity and scientization may narrow the academic vision of medicine, which is the so-called “cover of modernity” or “loss of Scientism”.<br>In this era of “science” worship. Science, as a knowledge system, has long been ideologized and plated with a too solemn aura. Therefore, the title of science is too much of a stake for the professional group of Medicine - to say who is not science implies a kind of dualistic exclusion thinking. If you are not a scientist, you must be non science, pseudoscience and anti science. This is a fatal “subversion” of professional identity.<br>What is the cost of one-sided scientization and technicalization of medicine? The price is the loss of medical humanism and the order of medical economy. Consumerism prevails. We seem to be used to naming patients with numbers that lack warmth. 35 beds, 42 specimens… Human suffering suddenly turns into cold pathological sections and images; In the hospital, there are rooms full of machines, plus expressionless strange faces; On the one hand, there is a serious shortage of health resources, on the other hand, there is extreme extravagance and waste.<br>Another philosopher who thinks in disease, tooms, pointed out sharply in the meaning of patients: “doctor, you are just observing, and I am experiencing”. She believes that there are “two worlds” in the process of patients. What I experience is pain (the patient’s world), and what you observe is disease (the doctor’s world). Disease and pain are not the same thing. The focus of your observation is disease rather than people, and medicine has forgotten “people”.<br>In fact, there are four types of “treatment” in the professional context: etiological treatment, etiological treatment, symptomatic treatment, and placebo treatment.<br>Trudeau, a famous doctor in the United States, has a famous saying: “sometimes to cure, often to care, always to comfort”. He engraved this sentence on his tombstone.<br>Musen: “although the cognitive content of medicine may be restored to biology, even physics and chemistry, medicine, as a whole discipline, cannot be restored to biology.”<br>Because its scientificity is in the “entanglement” of Humanities and social science knowledge and methods, medicine is no longer just a special technology, a tree of knowledge, a career to make a living, but a career and intellectual life full of pleasure.<br>The second section questions visualism and objectivism<br>Its cognitive root is the objectification, objectification and reductionist thinking of life, which obscures the subjectivity and experience of life activities; Its fatal injury is indifference to painful experience; The unbearable pain is the temperature of losing humanity in the process of diagnosis and treatment.<br>Section III “spiritual black hole” of medicine in the 20th century<br>In fact, this idea that science is naturally clean is harmful. Science does not have the characteristics of natural cleanliness and the function of self moral purification.<br>Section IV frontier technology faces serious ethical impact<br>Everyone is immersed in the “drama” of scientific development, competition, conquest, coronation and carnival. Everyone is competing. What is the result of the competition? This technology may completely erase the contingency and diversity of human reproduction. If cloning becomes a routine, there will be no contingency.<br>The consequences of this intervention in life will inevitably lead to the disorder of human relations and biological genealogy.<br>Section V tension between “ought to be” and “necessity”<br>Section 6 what is traditional Chinese medicine?<br>Traditional Chinese Medicine - because first it is effective, then it is reasonable. It can be effective and unreasonable, of course, it can also be effective and reasonable.<br>At present, the mission of Chinese culture is to return to its roots and create a new one: to return to its roots and revitalize the confidence of national culture; We should also open up a new era and embark on the journey of cultural innovation, and maintain the necessary tension between the two.<br>In the context of the intersection and dialogue between Chinese and Western painting, Mr. Pan Tianshou, a giant of traditional Chinese painting, has the wisdom of “drawing a distance between Chinese and Western painting”. This argument is also of enlightening significance to the future development of traditional Chinese medicine.<br>According to the inertial deduction of its survival and development in the 20th century, the evolution of traditional Chinese medicine has roughly three ways: first, being willing to live in the second class and continue to become complementary / alternative medicine; The second is to devote life experience, early clinical experience, research inspiration and materials to scientific and technological medicine from the west, and become a hypothesis base to be verified; Third, the full publicity of academic subjectivity has made it a Chinese type of medicine, catching up with and surpassing Western types of medicine in some fields (sub-health care, elderly diseases, chronic diseases, disability diagnosis and treatment), and creating new treatment characteristics and market patterns.</p>

            <p>What is medicine?</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Self Preface<br>All possible pain and salvation<br>Medicine has not only numerous technical goals (they are only some phased and local occupational tactics and strategic goals), but also social consensus on disease, pain, disability and health (they are compound occupational strategic goals that transcend Technology), as well as lofty humanitarian vision (they are the starting point and destination of the profession). Perhaps some people will disagree and think that this is a metaphysical dream of medical humanities, It aims to build a Utopia of human health, but we do need a Utopia to lead the eternal pursuit of human health.<br>The current problem is how to completely define the value system of technical objectives, social consensus and humanitarian vision.<br>As a social consensus and humanitarian vision, medicine should not be “the taming and Transcendence of life, old age, disease and death”, but “all possible pain and salvation”. The basic meaning of human happiness is “more happiness, less pain”.</p>
<p>Introduction<br>Eternal questions, eternal puzzles<br>What is medicine? A “luoshengmen” with many different theories.<br>As a common sense, medicine has three basic definitions:<br>The first is the knowledge and skill system of human (animal) physiology - health care, disease - prevention.<br>Second, it is a highly professional academic exploration and service activity, commonly known as “practicing medicine”, whose main body is called “medical scientist”.<br>The third is a part of the knowledge system of natural science, which is called “medical science”.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>According to the research contents, objects and methods, it is divided into three parts: Basic Medicine, clinical medicine and preventive medicine. In addition, there are other disciplines such as military medicine, forensic medicine, aviation medicine, cosmology and nautical medicine.<br>This is the “useful, effective, rational, prescriptive and categorical” (five haves) characteristics of medicine.<br>From this, we get the following two definitions: medical science takes the study of diseases as the object. Medical skill aims to maintain and restore health.<br>The core content (only pedigree) of “medicine” is composed of the basic theory and practice of medicine, including biomedicine, behavioral and Social Sciences, general clinical skills, clinical decision-making skills, communication skills, medical ethics and other modules.<br>Core content of “medicine” (competence pedigree) In addition to the scientific foundation, clinical skills and group health care, the consensus in seven fields is put forward. It also focuses on three abilities that keep pace with the times: communication skills, information management and critical thinking, and takes professional values, attitudes, behaviors and ethics as the core elements of medical students. Here, the professional values of doctors include virtue, altruism, responsibility, compassion, empathy, honesty, integrity, commitment to scientific methods, etc.<br>The academic system of clinical medicine specialty of Peking University Medical College and Peking Union Medical College is eight years. Compared with other medical schools, their first year is the pre medical stage. Students study general natural sciences, social sciences and Humanities at Peking University and Tsinghua University respectively; The last seven years will be the undergraduate stage of medicine. I will study basic medicine and clinical medicine courses in the medical department, medical college and clinical hospital, and complete clinical practice, scientific research training and graduation thesis. Students who have completed all courses according to the regulations and achieved excellent results can obtain the medical doctor’s degree.<br>The first stage: medical preparation stage (two semesters). In addition to foreign languages, politics, humanities, physical education and other public courses, it also includes calculus, inorganic chemistry and analytical chemistry, general biology, geometry and algebra, organic chemistry, college physics, physical chemistry, Fundamentals of computer software technology, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, probability theory and mathematical statistics, microbiology, developmental biology, bioinformatics and other courses.<br>The second stage: basic medicine stage (five semesters), which is conducted in medical schools / basic medical schools and pharmaceutical schools. Courses include human anatomy, histoembryology, physiology, microbiology, parasitology, medical immunology, medical genetics, pathological anatomy, pathophysiology, pharmacology, molecular biology, medical statistics, biophysics, neurobiology, medical literature retrieval, medical psychology, etc.<br>The third stage: clinical medicine stage (including probation, five semesters), in medical school / clinical medical school. Courses include diagnostics, radiation diagnosis, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and Gynecology, pediatrics, neurology and psychiatry, traditional Chinese medicine, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, Stomatology, dermatology, epidemiology and community health, hygiene, nuclear medicine, clinical epidemiology, clinical theory, physical medicine and rehabilitation medicine, clinical pharmacology, social medicine, allergy, clinical oncology, etc.<br>Stage 4: clinical practice and scientific research training (four semesters), of which 8 months before graduation is the time for scientific research training courses. Under the guidance of doctoral tutors, you must independently complete a scientific research topic and pass the oral defense.<br>The value space of medicine has the characteristics of “ladder progression”, the technical function and the basic bottom value of knowledge pedigree, the universal value highlighted by the social public understanding of medicine, and the ultimate value in the sense of human soul settling down are the higher and supreme boundaries of the medical profession.<br>Follow the direction of pragmatism to inquire about the ideal of medicine. The answer is to pursue and maximize medical utilitarianism and functional goals, such as conquering or controlling several acute and malignant diseases endangering human health within a limited time limit, establishing physical and chemical indicators to improve human quality of life and prolong life. The phased goal is to find a number of quick acting and effective new drugs, new operations and new equipment, and implement a number of health regulations and health welfare policies to eliminate diseases, reduce diseases, reduce disabilities and help the disabled, so as to promote human health. The implementation of industry indicators is to systematically improve vocational medical education and public health communication, improve the level of medical research, deeply explore patient mechanisms and solutions, effectively improve the situation of hospitals and doctors, and maximize the growing medical and health care needs of the public.<br>In the face of disease, we can’t know everything. In the face of health, we cannot be perfect. However, we can reflect on the limitations of the times and pursue the best of the times.<br>In fact, the ability to ask questions about a discipline, a profession and an era is by no means a “redundant” appendix, nor is it a “dragon slaying technique”, but the power of thinkers to sharpen their thinking. Therefore, Einstein once said: “raising problems is more important than solving problems”. For anyone with academic and spiritual life, to give up the power of “thinking” is to hand over the power of “questioning”. Once this power is handed over, no matter how the skills are developed, they can only be “craftsmen” whose vision is covered and whose spirit is castrated. It is impossible to make great achievements and innovations in the forefront of disciplines and professions.<br>Thirdly, the medical motif is not all some grand narrative propositions. The technical “category” highlighted at the level of professional operation is also the medical motif, for example:</li>
<li>“Intervention and adaptation”, including: why intervention? What is the cost of intervention? Where is the boundary of intervention? Philosophically, it reveals the unity of opposites of “conquest awe”, “killing symbiosis” and “medical care rescue”;</li>
<li>“Biology and life”: it leads us to distinguish the fundamental distinction between “visible spiritual”, “physiological psychological” and “corpse living”, and to understand the bias between “reductionism” and “vitality”;</li>
<li>“Observation and experience”: including the value collision of “objective subjective”, “disease suffering” and “discovering patients - creating patients”;</li>
<li>“Technology and art”: including the compatibility of “craft craft” and “standardization personalization”;</li>
<li>“Universality and individuality”: including the mutual consistency and compatibility of “internationality - locality”, “Globalization - localization” and “schematization - individualization”;</li>
<li>“Truth and true meaning” and “correctness justice”: it is the philosophical basis for the resurgence of contemporary “medical ethics” and aims to grasp the tension of “objectivity morality”, “reason conscience” and “this shore other shore” (technology and Religion) in medical services.<br>In fact, we should think about speed and realm when dealing with careers, undertakings, and even the advancement of life. We should not think that only “controlling the slow by the fast” is the right way. Sometimes we need a calm attitude of “controlling the fast by the slow”.<br>After thinking about “speed”, we should also consider the quality distinction and height rise and fall between “up” and “down” in the journey. Never “move forward” in the fall.</li>

            <p>Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest in and/or out of the classroom.    (Maximum 350 words）</p>
<p>Biology is the subject which has inspired me the most and I have been interested in this subject since I first learnt it in my junior high school. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not part of my senior High School curriculum, so I decided to do further studies outside the school. My biology course started in a training institution which was a study center of AQA (The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance) and this was the first time I began my interest in this particular subject. During class, I learned about cell structure, human body mechanisms and so on. Apart from focusing on the topics in the textbook, I also discussed derived questions such as why COVID-19 mutates so rapidly with my teacher after class since she was keen on connecting theory with real life.</p>
<p>However, my extracurricular activities were more than that. I read many books in this field such as “The Selfish Gene” (Richard Dawkins, 1976) which was my favorite. From the book, I not only expanded my breadth of knowledge, but also learnt some of the author’s opinions such as “Even if we are all driven by selfish genes, good people will be rewarded” which has developed my critical thinking. </p>
<p>In addition, I went to a biopharmaceutical company and took part in several experiments. These improved my practical skills by learning how to use different experimental apparatus such as a pipette gun in the laboratory. Furthermore, I was invited to join in a project in the company about a new biomedical drug invention. Although I could only take part in a small section of the whole process, I was very pleased to do it since this was a perfect chance for me to see how professional staff can be involved in the production of a new drug which would benefit people suffering from gastroenteritis, which was closely connected to real life.</p>
<p>To summarize, the experience improved my ability to solve problems and come up with new ideas to solve real life dilemmas as well as learning basic knowledge about this career. This will lay the foundation for my broader career choice in the future.</p>

            <p>Today, I wnet to a compamy called 91360 which aims to provide AI technology for assisting pathologic diagnosis, which is called cloud diagnostics and remote consultation of medical care, but I wnat to focus on the first part. This project is TB which means it is towards business which are hospitals.</p>
<p>The company had gotten the first China class III medical device certificate from FDA. It was really hard due to the difficulty of entering this career and scarcity of workers in the specific filed who are called pathologists with at least 10 years’ working experience to be experts. Although they do not contact with patients directly, they need to have the ability to dignose diseases such as what kinds of cancer the patient had by observing cell or tissue sections under light microscope. There is a huge workload since all kinds of cancer cells are different in structures and the number of cells within a small area is so large. However, this technology combines the AI with the dignosing process by converting the physical section of cells into digital image. The algorithm can use the microscpoe and scanner which together form slice scanner inside the system to mark the positions of abnormal cells in the whole area contaning about twenty thousand cells. This offers a easier way for pathologists to screen the cancer cells and make further decisions.</p>
<p>There are two main parts for the promotions of innovation. One is cytology and the other is histology. The main difference between them is use of detathced cells and a piece of tissue though they are both one thin layer of cells. Additionally, the difference also contains  traumatic and atraumatic. It needs to be mentioned that the second method offers a more precise relative position of the tumor.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic information about the mechanism, the technology can not completly replace all pathologists yet as some experts are necessary to face new situations or problems that the computer can not solve. Also, the avalible sample size for the study of AI is small and the accuracy can only get 98% by learning at least 1 million samples. Moreover the knowledge beyond the present cognition of people can not be learned by the AI. In this way, AI is not so good as human brain in innovation although it has better abilities in processing data, integrated presentation and other basic work. Furthermore, the existed laws can not deal with the damage of people caused by AI which means it has some ethical problems.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important thing I learned from the teacher today is the language study. In short, it can help people in many aspects including expression, imgination, analysis, observation and coming up with new idea as well as solution beyond the science Learning.</p>

            <p>What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p>I believe that the skill of playing the piano is my pride and joy. I have played the piano for about 13 years and I started it when I was only 4 years old.</p>
<p>Initially, I just played the piano for pleasure, but now it means much more than that to me. It is true that repeating playing certain melodies everyday was so boring and irritating in the beginning. However, such simple practice was necessary to build up basic skills. I took all the level examinations throughout my piano career, such as Domestic Piano band 10 and ABRSM performance level, but it could be argued those are just methods of testing the standard way of playing different musical pieces from different eras such as the Baroque period.</p>
<p>What attracted me most about playing the piano was the opportunity of performing in front of an audience and learning from others including masters and contestants, which improved both my confidence and vision. I think these competitions and performance experiences have been very important so that I can be who I am now.</p>
<p>I have been to several countries due to my piano playing including the US and Austria but the country which impressed me most was France. There were two reasons for our visit to France. The first was attending master courses and the second was performing at various venues. It is a beautiful and romantic country and I learned a lot about local culture there. When I took part in the course, I learnt specific professional knowledge from the teachers about Jazz and Classical styles. In addition, we gave a charity performance in a church which was peaceful and atmospheric. The audience were so polite and very respectful wearing formal clothes which was pleasing. Therefore, I enjoyed playing the piano in that environment since people showed respect to me.</p>
<p>Although I have decided not to go down the professional road of music, it is a kind of invisible power to support me through difficulties and make me persist in improving my piano technique.</p>

            <p>Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side. (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p>When I was in the sixth grade of primary school, I took part in a printmaking competition called “Lotus Race”. The purpose of the competition was to choose excellent works of art based on their originality from primary school pupils and exhibit them in an art museum near the Nanjing Library.</p>
<p>I was encouraged to take part by my art teacher since I was a member of the printmaking club in our school. In addition, I was also interested in drawing at that time, so I decided to have a try.</p>
<p>In preparation for the first draft, I drew with a 6B pencil which had a darker color for leaving a mark on the sponge paper under the draft and a piece of 4K paper which was about twice the size of A4 paper. At the start of the process, I was not sure what to draw however, I suddenly came up with a good idea which was to draw a robot. In 2015, robots seemed to be gradually appearing in people’s lives, used for activities such as sweeping, guiding the general public to various destinations like in Nanjing and robots who help in the kitchen. I thought that they could help people in many ways as fabulous assistants since I wanted to create more opportunities for robots to help humans, so I focused on firefighting. It was not an unrealistic idea as I discovered that forest fires occurred frequently because of dry weather in various areas of China. If there was a robot to help, it could be easier since the robots could be controlled remotely and firefighters could avoid the dangers of being close to fierce fires.</p>
<p>After some creative thinking, my first draft of the design was finished. The robot had a big square head for scanning and patrolling, eight long legs with wheels for fast movement and the fire extinguishing system in its body. Although I was still young, which meant some details were not precise enough, I tried my best to make the scene look realistic by drawing a background which showed the robot putting out the fire of buildings in a busy city center with spray pipes.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I won a prize and my work was shown in the exhibition. It was an impressed experience as it inspired me to use my creativity to contribute to the society in the future. Just as the saying goes “creativity comes from life.”</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 15 constraints on Perfection<br>I have been trying to show the advantages and disadvantages of adaptation theory, but the main purpose of this chapter is to make a list and classify various constraints on perfection, and to list the main reasons why students should move forward cautiously in the process of learning adaptability. Before discussing my six constraints on perfection, let’s talk about the other three constraints that others have put forward, but I find they are not very convincing. First, the debate on “neutral mutation” among contemporary biochemical geneticists has been cited in the criticism of adaptation theory, but in fact, the two are irrelevant. If there are neutral mutations called by biochemists, it means that any changes in protein structure caused by these mutations have no effect on protein enzyme activity. This means that these neutral mutations will not change the process of embryonic development, nor will they have any phenotypic effects at all - the phenotypic effects understood by biologists as a whole. The biochemical debate on neutrality is mainly concerned with an interesting and important question: whether all gene substitutions have phenotypic effects. The debate on adaptation theory is quite different. Its main concern is that since the phenotypic effect we study is large enough to be observed and raises questions about it, we should assume that it is the product of natural selection. Biochemists’ neutral mutation is not just neutral. As long as we biologists who study rudimentary morphology, physiology and behavior consider this problem, they are no longer mutations in our eyes. It is with this idea that Maynard Smith wrote: “I interpret the ‘rate of evolution’ as the rate of adaptive change. In this sense, the substitution of a neutral allele does not constitute evolution. “ If a biologist who studies biological individuals sees a phenotypic difference determined by genes, he already knows that he cannot be studying the “neutrality” debated by a contemporary biochemical geneticist.<br>The second one, which is proposed for the perfection restriction, considers the problem of allometric growth: “for deer of the subfamily Cervus, the growth rate of antler size is much faster than that of body size… So that larger deer have disproportionately large antlers. So there is no need to find a clear reason for the huge antlers on the big deer’s head. “ Of course, Levantin’s remark illustrates some problems, but I prefer to restate it. According to his words, the allometric growth rate should be a constant, as if it was an unalterable thing designated by God. However, constants on one time scale may also change on another time scale. Allometric growth constant is a parameter in embryonic development. Like any other such parameter, it may be dominated by genetic changes and may therefore change during evolution. In this way, levintin’s statement is similar to the following statement: all primates have teeth, which is just a fact about primates, so there is no need to give a clear adaptive reason for primates having teeth. However, what he really wants to express may be something similar to the following.<br>Leventin’s view on gene pleiotropy is related to another problem, which I should discuss here first. The problem is the definition of what he calls natural “suture” - the “phenotypic unit” of evolution. Sometimes the double effects of a gene are inseparable in theory. They are different sides of the same thing. Just as Mount Everest once had two names, it depends on which side you look at it. The oxygen carrying molecules in the eyes of a biochemist may be red in the eyes of behaviorists. But there is also a more interesting gene pleiotropy, in which the two phenotypic effects can be separated. The phenotypic effect of any gene (relative to its allele) is not the private property of the gene itself, but can be revealed with the help of the embryonic environment in which it plays a role. This provides a full opportunity for the phenotypic effect of one mutation to be changed by other effects, and also provides a basis for some excellent ideas, such as Fisher’s theory of dominant evolution, Medawar and Williams’ theory of aging, and Hamilton’s theory of Y chromosome embedding. In this connection, if a mutation has a favorable effect and a harmful effect, there is no reason why selection does not favor a modifier gene, which can separate the two phenotypic effects, or weaken the harmful effect and enhance the beneficial effect. As in the case of allometric growth, leventin’s view of gene behavior is too static, treating pleiotropy as the private property of the gene itself, rather than as the result of the interaction between the gene and its modifiable embryonic environment.<br><strong>Time lag</strong><br>The animals we see today are likely to be “outdated”, and the genes that affect their establishment process were selected at an earlier time to cope with different conditions from today.<br><strong>Historical constraints</strong><br>My own experience is that there may be a solution to the real paradox of historical constraints. The analogy of jet engine implies that animals should be funny giants made up at random under the spur, with strange relics left by patchy antiques in their unstable bodies.<br><strong>Available genetic changes</strong><br>No matter how strong a potential selection pressure is, it will not necessarily lead to evolution unless there is a genetic change that makes the selection pressure work.<br>Nature does not have the foresight to combine a series of mutations to put a strain on the path to the ultimate global optimum - even if they may lead to temporary shortcomings. Nature cannot restrain itself from favoring the available mutations that can bring small advantages at present, even if they can get greater benefits from the optimal mutations that will appear later. Like a river, natural selection blindly improves its downward path along an immediately selectable continuous route with minimal obstacles. It can be imagined that the animals obtained from this are not the most perfect design, or even just barely survive. It is the product of a series of historical changes, and each change at most represents the option that happened to be better at that time.<br><strong>Cost and material constraints</strong><br>I think the above hypothesis is more constructive and interesting than the hypothesis that “the necessary mutation never appeared”. Of course, we have to admit that the former hypothesis may also be true, but I prefer to just take it as the last straw.<br><strong>Imperfection caused by the selective action of another level at one level</strong><br>One of the main problems to be solved in this book is the level at which natural selection plays a role. The adaptability we should see when selection acts on the level of biological groups will be quite different from the adaptability we expect to see when selection acts on the level of biological individuals. It can be concluded that what one individual selectionist regards as adaptability may not be perfect in the eyes of another group selectionist.<br><strong>Errors caused by unpredictability or “malice” of the environment</strong><br>No matter how well an animal adapts to the environment, these environmental conditions must also be regarded as a statistical average. It is usually impossible for us to deal with every conceivable accident in detail, so any given animal will often be observed to make a “mistake” - easily fatal. This is not the same as the time lag problem already mentioned. The time lag problem arises because of the uncertainty of environmental statistics: the current average conditions are different from those experienced by the ancestors of animals. The problem here is even more inevitable. Modern animals may live under the average conditions consistent with their ancestors, but the possible events in the environment they face are also different every day. These situations are too complex to make accurate prediction.<br>Such cases always make us wonder why these organisms still obey these manipulations against their best interests on the time scale of evolution? Why doesn’t selection simply erase the Robin’s vulnerability to cuckoo deception? I believe that such problems and many other problems will one day become the basis for a new branch of Biology - the science of manipulation, arms race, and phenotype.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 13 gene extension<br>There is a disturbing contradiction at the core of selfish gene theory, which exists between genes and the carrier of life - life. On the one hand, we have got a beautiful story: independent DNA replication factors are as flexible as antelopes. They are freely handed down from generation to generation, temporarily combined in disposable biological containers, and the immortal double helix is constantly reorganized and inherited, honed when forming a decaying body, and finally move towards their own eternity. On the other hand, if we only observe the individual life itself, every life is a self-contained instrument, which is perfect, complex and precise, but unified and closely organized. Life is not just a product of a loose and temporary combination of genes. When sperm and eggs are about to start a new gene mixing process, these “Warring” gene vectors do not just know each other. With a dedicated brain, life coordinates the cooperation between limbs and sensory organs to complete various biological purposes. As a carrier, its work has reached the acme.<br>I think the most important question for any parasite is whether it transmits its genes to its offspring in the same way as the host’s genes. If not, I think it damages the host in various ways. But if they are the same, what a parasite can do is help its host survive and reproduce. With the progress of evolution, it will no longer be a parasite, but will cooperate with the host, and even eventually integrate into the host tissue. It is completely unable to identify it as a parasite. As I mentioned in Chapter 10, our cells have gone through this evolutionary process. We are actually the relics of all ancient parasitic biosynthesis.<br>Again, the main point here is: the genes of parasitic organisms need to pursue a common destiny and enjoy common interests with the host genes, so that parasitic organisms will eventually stop parasitic behavior.<br>One way to remind us is that even today, the phenotypic effects of not all genes are limited to the individual organisms in which they are located. In theory and in practice, genes cross the boundaries of individual organisms and manipulate objects in the external world, including inanimate things, living organisms and distant things. With a little imagination, we can see that genes sit in the center of the extended phenotypic radiation network. Any object in the world is at the node of this influence network, which comes from many genes in many organisms. There is no obvious boundary between the coverage of genes. The whole world is a cross, a causal arrow pointing to phenotypic effects by aggregated genes, either far or near.<br>There is another phenomenon: these crosses are gradually gathering. In fact, this phenomenon is very important and difficult to be ignored as an incidental phenomenon, but it is not enough to have a thorough foothold in theory. Replication factors no longer roam freely in the ocean, but gather into a huge group - individual organisms. Phenotypic changes are no longer evenly distributed in practice, and in many cases aggregate in the same body. We are familiar with the individual creatures on earth, but none of them ever existed on earth. No matter where in the universe, the only thing life needs is immortal replication factors.<br>Chapter 14 gene determinism and gene selection theory<br>What did genes do to have such an evil and irresistible reputation? Why don’t we demonize nursery education or confirmation courses into similar monsters? Why is it that only genes are considered more certain and irresistible than television, nuns or books? Ladies, don’t blame your husband for going out and fooling around. It’s not their fault to be stimulated by pornographic culture! The so-called Jesuits often boast, “give me your child’s first seven years and I’ll give you a man back.” That may make sense. Under certain conditions, the influence of education or other cultures may be as unalterable and irreversible as the influence of genes, and more people believe that “stars” have such influence.<br>I suspect that the reason why genes have become the monster of determinism is partly due to the confusion caused by a well-known fact, that is, the non heritability of learned characteristics. Before this century, it was widely believed that a person’s life experience and other knowledge gains could be imprinted on genetic material in some way and passed on to children. Later, people abandoned this cognition and replaced it with Weisman’s theory of germplasm continuity and its corresponding theory “central law” at the molecular level, which is one of the great achievements of modern biology. If we are in the inference of the orthodox theory of Weismann genetic school, genes do seem to be immutable and irresistible. They have been handed down from generation to generation, affecting the body that can’t escape death from generation to generation in form and behavior. However, apart from those rare nonspecific mutation effects, genes are never affected by the environment in which the body’s experience lives (in terms of genes, this view is correct). However, the chemical modification of genes and histones also leads to the existence of epigenetic phenomena, and the heritable expression of genetic information will be affected by environmental factors. Epigenetics is the most advanced genetic research in the past 20 years, so it is impossible for the author to understand it when writing this book). The genes in my body come from my four grandparents. These genes flow directly from them through my parents and reach me. What my parents have acquired, acquired, learned or experienced will not have any impact on the gene itself when these genes flow through them. On this point, there may be some evil. However, no matter how unchangeable and unshakable these genes are from generation to generation, the shape of the phenotype shown in the body they flow through is not unchangeable and unshakable at all. If I am a homozygous of gene G, nothing can stop me from passing gene G to all my children except mutation. But there are so many things that cannot be changed. As for whether I, or my children, can show the phenotypic characteristics generally associated with having gene G, it often depends more on how we were raised, what kind of food we ate, what kind of education we experienced, and what other genes we happen to have. Therefore, among the two major effects of genes - making more copies of themselves and affecting phenotypes - the first effect is indeed not easy to change (if rare mutations are aside), while the other effect is highly variable. I think the confusion between evolution and development is also partly responsible for the myth of genetic determinism.<br>Most of this chapter is based on the assumption that a biologist may want to infer the “function” of a behavior pattern within the framework of Darwinism. This does not mean that all behavior patterns must have a Darwinian function. There may be a large class of behavior patterns that are neutral or even harmful to individual organisms in selection, and can not be regarded as the product of natural selection. If this is the case, the discussion in this chapter does not apply to them. However, one expression is very reasonable: “I am very interested in adaptability. I don’t have to think of all behavior patterns as adaptability, but I want to study those behavior patterns that are adaptive. “ Similarly, the expression prefers to study vertebrates rather than invertebrates does not mean that we believe that all animals are vertebrates. Considering that the field of interest is adaptive behavior, when we talk about the Darwinian evolution of the object of interest, it is impossible not to assume a genetic basis in advance. Using “gene for X” as a concise way to talk about “gene basis needed to realize X” is a standard operation of population genetics for more than half a century.</p>

            <p>Describe an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p> In 2020, shortly after my IGCE exams, teachers and parents cooperated to organize a professional experience in the workplace, which let my classmates and I find our interests in future careers such as banking, network technology researcher, medicine and learn more about the work content in detail.</p>
<p>There were eight choices and these included Agricultural Bank of China, Network Technology Company, work experience in a dental hospital and so on. I was interested in a job related to biology and health, moreover I dreamt of becoming a doctor, so I chose the dental hospital placement.</p>
<p>Dentists use a lot of new technology and one area we studied was digital scanning which is used for oral modeling. The scanner transmitted the real-time oral image to the computer which automatically generated the tooth model immediately. As the dentist manipulated the scanner in her hand, she adjusted the image on the computer to make it complete. I realized that nowadays, almost every job uses computer technology which is something I learnt on this work placement. Then, training was given in plaque staining and scientific brushing. After rinsing with water, red edible dye showed teeth with soft debris. When the leading dentist worked with a student to give a demonstration of how to brush teeth in the right way, she did every step carefully in order to avoid any mistakes and was very thorough in her instructions which was helpful for learning quickly. Compared with doing surgical operations, this is simpler and less stressful. A dentist needs to communicate with his patients patiently to make sure everything goes well. I discovered that a clear mind is also very important for most activities in life! Additionally, a calm mind can ensure that timely remedial measures will quickly come to mind and avoid irreparable consequences, such as sequelae of the patient.</p>
<p>I benefited a lot from this visit and discovered that I am suitable for this kind of work which requires patience and care. Furthermore, I need to put more effort into the study of computer programming since it appears to be very important in this field.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                        SHEN ZIYOU</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 11 finding mother: new replication factors<br>But do we have to go to the distant universe to find other kinds of replication factors and other kinds of subsequent evolutionary phenomena? I think a new type of replication factor has recently appeared on our planet. It was right in front of us, but it was still in its infancy and awkwardly drifting in its original soup. But it is driving the process of evolution, and the speed is beyond the reach of the original factors.<br>This new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for this new replication factor. The name should be able to express the concept of a cultural communication unit or imitation unit“ The word “mimeme” comes from a proper Greek root, but I want a monosyllabic word that sounds a bit like “gene”. If I shorten the word “mimeme” to meme, I hope my classical friends will forgive me more. We can think that memory is related to memory or French m ê me, if it can make some people feel a little comfort. This word should rhyme with “cream”.<br>As my colleague N.K. Humphrey pointed out brilliantly when he summarized the content of the first draft of this chapter: “finding a mother should be regarded as a viable structure, which is not only a metaphor, but also academic. When you transplant a viable mother seeking into my heart, in fact, you turn my brain into the mother seeking host and make it a tool to spread the mother seeking, just like the genetic mechanism of a virus parasitic on a host cell. This is not just out of thin air. For example, the mother of “spiritual belief after death” can actually become material. As a structure in the nervous system of people all over the world, it obtains material power millions of times. “<br>Let’s study the concept of “God”. We don’t know how it was first produced in the mother seeking library. It probably appeared after many independent “mutation” processes. Anyway, the concept of “God” is really very old. How does it replicate itself? It is reproduced and spread through oral words and written words with the help of great music and great art. Why does it have such high survival value? You should remember that the “survival value” here does not mean the value of genes in the gene pool, but the value of looking for mothers in the mother pool. The real meaning of this question is what gives the stability and permeability of the concept of “God” in the cultural environment. The survival value of God’s mother seeking library comes from its strong psychological appeal“ The concept of “God” provides a seemingly plausible answer to some profound and distressing questions about survival. It implies that all kinds of unfairness in this world can be corrected in the afterlife. God stretched out his “eternal arms” to bear our human defects, just like a placebo prescribed by doctors for patients, which will also produce certain effects due to spiritual effects. This is part of the reason why God is accepted by people and copied and spread in people’s minds from generation to generation. We can say that in the environment provided by human culture, the image of God exists in the form of mother seeking with high survival value or appeal.<br>Broadly speaking, mother seeking replicates herself by imitation. But just as not all genes that can replicate themselves are good at self replication, some mothers in the mother searching library can achieve greater success than others. This process is similar to natural selection. I have listed some characteristics that help to improve the survival value of mother seeking. But generally speaking, these characteristics must be the same as those of replication factors mentioned in Chapter 2: longevity, fecundity and precise replication ability. Relatively speaking, it may not be important whether any mother seeking copy can live long, which is the same for a gene copy.<br>We need not seek the general biological survival value of various characteristics such as religion, music and sacrificial dance, although these values may also exist. Once a gene provides its survival machine with a brain capable of rapid imitation, the mother will automatically take over. We don’t even have to assume that imitation has some genetic superiority, although it will certainly bring convenience. The essential condition is that the brain should be able to imitate: then there will be a mother seeking to make full use of this ability.<br>Human beings may also have an extraordinary feature - the ability to show sincere and selfless altruistic behavior. I only wish so, but I am not going to debate this in any form, nor do I intend to speculate whether this feature can be attributed to the evolution of mother seeking. What I want to explain is that even if we focus on the dark side and assume that people are basically selfish, our conscious foresight - the ability to simulate the future in imagination - can prevent ourselves from conniving at blind replication factors to do the worst and excessive selfish acts. We have at least the spiritual strength to take care of our long-term selfish interests, not just short-term selfish interests. We can see the long-term benefits of participating in the “pigeon group”, and we can sit down and discuss ways to make the group successful. We have enough strength to resist our innate selfish genes. When necessary, we can also resist the selfish mother seeking instilled in our minds. We can even discuss how to carefully cultivate pure and selfless altruism, which has no place in nature and is unprecedented in the whole world history. We are built as genetic machines and trained as mother seeking machines, but we have enough strength to oppose our founders. In this world, only we, human beings, can resist the tyranny of selfish replication factors.<br>Chapter 12 a good man is rewarded<br>No one would think of bacteria as a conscious strategist, but parasitic bacteria seamlessly interact with their hosts in a prisoner’s dilemma. There is no reason not to use Axelrod’s Theory - kindness, tolerance, no jealousy, etc. to study their strategies. Axelrod and Hamilton pointed out that harmless and beneficial bacteria can become harmful or even fatal sepsis when people are injured. Doctors will say that the body’s “natural resistance” will decline when injured. But perhaps the real reason is the game of prisoner’s dilemma. In the human body, do bacteria gain and constantly test their returns? In the game between human body and bacteria, the “shadow of the future” is usually very long, because an ordinary person can live for many years at any starting point. However, a seriously injured person may bring a short future to its parasitic bacteria“ The temptation of betrayal is suddenly more attractive than the reward of mutual cooperation. Of course, bacteria don’t count these things in their evil little heads! The natural selection of generations of bacteria has cultivated them into an unconscious organism. The primary task is to maintain life by biochemistry.<br>Vampire bats are mysterious. For fans of Victorian Gothic novels, they are often dark forces that intimidate others at night, suck blood and sacrifice innocent lives to meet their selfish desires. In addition, other Victorian mysterious events and bats’ naturally bright red teeth and claws, aren’t blood sucking ghost bats the embodiment of the most frightening power of nature’s selfish genes? I scoff at these mysterious events. If we want to know the truth behind an event, we need to study it. What Darwinism gives us is not a detailed description of a particular creature, but a more subtle but valuable tool: the understanding of principles. If we must add a mysterious event, it is the truth - the story of the noble character of vampire bats. For bats themselves, blood is not thicker than water. They transcend kinship and form their long-term and solid ties among loyal friends. Vampire bats can tell a new mystery story, a story about sharing, mutual assistance and cooperation. They show this kind thought: even if we are all at the helm of selfish genes, good people will be rewarded.</p>
