            <p>What is medicine?</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter V medicine in literary images</p>
<p>Section 1 understanding medicine in literature<br>But when people celebrate the great achievements of modern medicine, should we revisit Montaigne’s teachings in those days:<br>Science is indeed a very useful cause. People who despise science can only prove its stupidity, but I will not exaggerate the value of science to the extent that some people say… I don’t believe what someone says: science is the mother of all virtues, and any evil is the product of ignorance. (Raymond sepanzan, 1580)<br>In addition, technology worship is also a hard “shell” for many technical elites. They can only understand diseases and medicine from the perspective of the technical regulations and index system of the body. People’s psychological, social and behavioral characteristics and their relationship with the occurrence and evolution of diseases are completely excluded from their ideological and academic Suites.<br>If the medical profession abandons humanistic cultivation, it is not only a tragedy, but also a satire, because technology and humanities are the two wings of medicine, and they can’t fly without any wings; Moreover, if the wing of humanity is broken, the devil will take advantage of it and dress up as it, leading medicine astray.</p>
<p>Section 3 pain and medicine on canvas<br>Religion uses reincarnation, Nirvana, Nirvana, and ascension to continue the spiritual journey in the future. In the context of religion, the body is not important, and the settlement of the soul is the most important. A series of reincarnation, liberation, happiness, and ascension hints sanctify and aestheticize the meaning of death, which is almost the same as sleep.</p>
<p>Extra-Is “Noah’s Ark” a leaky ship?<br>It is absolutely true to say that “the health of the disease” alone. If every index is screened according to the physiological normal value, there is no pure “healthy person” in the world. Therefore, people who pursue health should be open-minded and do not have to worry about the fluctuation of some small indexes (but the core index should not be taken lightly. If you find abnormalities, you should seek medical advice in time and avoid carelessness).<br>Similarly, medicine saves lives, cures diseases and wounds. Has it ever had a sense of life? No one is suspicious. Imagine that a medicine lacking a sense of life can undertake the sacred mission of health care and medical treatment for humans, a group of creatures with spirituality flying in the world (in addition to biological indicators, there are also psychology, emotion, behavior and wisdom)? Raising such questions is “bad”, as telling people that Noah’s Ark is a leaky ship. Many patients regard medicine, doctors and hospitals as Noah’s Ark in their life crisis. Noah’s Ark is missing. Does it not lose the hope and opportunity of life?<br>The purpose of writing this book is to remind our medical students and professional doctors to consciously build marginalized reading paths and diverse thinking dimensions, arouse their rethinking of the function and essence of medicine, help them break through the scientific barrier between science and humanities, heal the “lameness” of medical humanities, and provide some humanistic nourishment for medical professional life, so as to surpass the craftsman style rigidity and brittleness, Improve the human realm of human medical activities.</p>

            <p>What is medicine?</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter IV medical model and research program</p>
<p>Section 1 historical form and evolution of medical model<br>This is first manifested in the “onion” model in the field of basic medicine: it seems that as long as there is a microscope and a scalpel, it can be infinitely peeled off (subdivided). Such biased reductionism makes people feel a lack of radial research and the loss of research frontiers.</p>
<p>Section 2 spiritual upheaval and hesitation of contemporary medicine<br>It should be admitted that at the beginning of the rise of modern medicine, the mechanistic strategy of mind body dualism successfully got rid of the entanglement of the uncertainty of complex systems. The separation of diseases and patients helps doctors find various means to eliminate diseases. With the deepening of medical research, the strategy of mind body dualism has been challenged, and physicians have realized that the research pattern of mind body division must be broken in contemporary times. However, today’s resistance does not come from the authority of theology, but from the strong inertia of biological (reductionist method) research, from the arrogance and prejudice of biological factor determinism, and from the modern disease of technology supremacy.<br>Ail ment: trouble - &gt; minor illness<br>Dis disease: uncomfortable, uncomfortable, not relaxed – &gt; disease<br>Dis order: disorder - &gt; disease<br>Ill ness: discomfort, misfortune, injury, suffering – &gt; disease<br>Sick ness: discomfort, discomfort, nausea, dizziness – &gt; disease<br>Buffer ing: patient, pain, subjective feelings - &gt; illness<br>The interpretation system of ideal medicine must be pluralistic, not unitary, because man is the most complex organism in the world, and he is also a political animal, an economic animal, a social and cultural animal. Of course, we can’t inquire the answer only from the genetic dimension.<br>Therefore, we are not worried about the technology and achievements that human beings may invent, design and manufacture new life at all. What we are worried about is how to control these artificial lives and how to give them appropriate ethical status.<br>The application and innovation of gene recombination technology is only a matter of time for human scientific progress. According to today’s scientific research inertia, human beings will sooner or later control and use this technology, but if technology and ethics are unbalanced, technology divorced from human rationality will lead to unexpected evil.<br>The excessive pursuit of modularization, standardization and schematization in clinical medicine is a cognitive Puritanism. In essence, it is necessary to overcome subjectivity with objectivity, and probability, contingency and relativity with inevitability and absoluteness, so as to coat clinical medicine with an idealistic aura.<br>However, it is not easy to completely expel empiricism. The wisdom of human reason is not observation, but understanding. It includes three levels: first, the premise and fulcrum of understanding, that is, the ability and skill to fully seek evidence; The second is the pure form of understanding, or its logical form, which is usually expressed as the logical and universalist principles in cognition; The third is a kind of decision-making ability in situations. It is the externalization of insight and comprehension in practice, and it is also a truth method that contains artistic flexibility in human thinking. The accumulation and cultivation of this ability are inseparable from individual experience and experience. In this sense, evidence-based medicine is dominant in the first and second levels, but there is a stiff joint in the third level. In essence, modern medicine is still a craft.<br>The philosophical radial of reductionism is simplification and simplification. On the one hand, it is to restore life phenomena to physical phenomena, on the other hand, it is to restore human life phenomena (human medicine) to ordinary life phenomena (sometimes simply called biomedicine) within biology, and restore advanced and complex life processes to linear causal chain reactions triggered by genes or pathogens.<br>Human life and disease are increasingly visualized, indexed and mechanized. Doctors are also increasingly becoming stories of machine manipulation, people and money. Human “disappearance” has become the most thorny problem in real medical and health care life.<br>Freud found that people are not the masters of their own behavior and spirit, they are largely dominated by the subconscious.<br>Of course, the efforts of psychoanalysis to carry out questionnaire surveys with the help of standardized instruments and standardized scales are not completely inappropriate, and the mistake is to place them in the shrine of uniqueness and absoluteness.<br>The dilemma of current medical reform reflects the value loss of modern medicine and the calm about the value loss.<br>Public health education only cares about the popularization of knowledge, and does not involve the chewing and value inquiry of the fatalistic significance of life, age, illness and death.<br>From the perspective of ideological history, medicine in the 20th century is wrapped in a huge value black hole, that is, the uniqueness and determinism of biological indicators triggered by scientism. We lack deep reflection on this, and these black holes are shaking the value foundation of medicine and changing its professionalism and ultimate goal.</p>

            <p>What is medicine?</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter III hospitals and patients</p>
<p>Section 1 Why do humans need hospitals<br>There are three realms of clinical medical assistance. The first realm is treatment, focusing on the survival of the body and technical intervention; The second realm is salvation, which focuses on both body and mind, and emotional care; The third realm is redemption, focusing on the integration of subject and object, and thoroughly understanding and sublimation. Understand what? “Meet Tuesday” tells us that the hospital is the last classroom of life. Here, we have a thorough understanding of the true meaning of life.<br>Life is just a journey, and the body cannot last forever<br>Death is the return of physical life, and the spirit (love) is eternal<br>To live to death, short life is meaningful</p>
<p>Section 2 what’s wrong with patients?<br>In English, there is a difference between “disease” and “illness”: a disease is a clinical judgment that deviates from the normal (healthy) state based on the specific etiology, special symptoms, and positive indications detected by laboratories and various modern medical instruments. The patient is the painful experience and physical and mental experience that the disease individual tells.<br>Professor Arthur Kleinman, a medical psychologist and sociologist at Harvard University, believes that “disease” and “illness” are two different worlds: a world of doctors and a world of patients; One is the world observed and recorded, and the other is the world experienced and described; One is to find the objective world of etiology and pathological indicators, and the other is to tell the subjective world of psychological and social painful experience.</p>
<p>Section 3 mission shift of modern medicine<br>Therefore, the “greed for life and fear of death” in the realistic context is a social consciousness bred in the soil of technicism and consumerism.</p>

            <p>What is medicine？</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter II The essence of medicine and philosophical insight</p>
<p>Section 1 what is the essence of medicine?</p>
<p>Edmund D. peilegrino, a modern medical ideologist, believes that medicine is binary and consistent in nature. It is not only the path of science, but also the path of humanities, but also the most humane and scientific discipline in science and humanities.<br>In other words, the objectivity in clinical medicine is inexhaustible, and the subjectivity is floating. Only the good situation of subjectivity and objectivity (the integration of doctors and patients derived from empathy) can have the harmony of doctor-patient communication.<br>Medical philosophy focuses on the spiritual confusion of the medical profession, which is manifested in the ultimate concern of medicine and the concern for the fate of doctors. Academically, medical philosophy has three connotations: first, philosophical problems in medicine, which can be divided into three levels: philosophical speculation in the exploration of medical experiments and theoretical hook, philosophical insight and insight in clinical diagnosis and treatment, and philosophical introduction and guidance in medical education; Second, compared with non philosophical medicine (doctors), medicine or doctors who enter the philosophical (speculative) secluded realm appear to be more profound and open, with more philosophical realm and more mellow philosophical temperament; The third is the intersection and exchange, thinking, reference and mutual penetration of the two university subjects of medicine and philosophy. Amplifying the context can be extended to the dialogue between science and humanities, technology and humanity.<br>The topic pedigree and academic path of modern philosophy show a certain tendency of specialization (formalization), which is farther and farther away from specific life and real life. The research purpose of medical philosophy is just very close to life and life, and has distinct theoretical value of returning to the secular world (grounding).</p>
<p>Section 2 philosophical metaphor of Medicine<br>Ancient Chinese philosophers like to use fables to show the metaphor of life and reveal the cover door of medicine. Many idioms and stories that people are familiar with are rich in the philosophy of life and medical insight.<br>For example, the “terminally ill” in Zuo Zhuan Cheng Gong’s ten years indicates that there is an unreachable absolute space between the terminally ill, implying that there is an eternal blind spot in medicine, and that it is impossible to reach the realm of omniscience, omnipotence and goodness. All those who try to cross this uncertain boundary and reach the other side of the terminally ill are delusional.<br>Zhuangzi - “death of chaos” metaphors that there is eternal uncertainty in life, which can not be attributed to the absolute truth of the positivist path, the taming of uncertainty, and the elimination of contingency and contingency, just give birth to the end of life.<br>Zhuangzi, the master of health preservation - “solving cattle for industry” means that there are many risks in life. Only by avoiding those numerous survival risks can we swim between bones, hurt the true Qi and vitality, and live a long life.<br>“The peach blossom garden” – “the peach blossom garden” metaphors the reincarnation of life and escapes into another more wonderful world. Death is not enough to fear, even a little cute<br>Chang ahan Jing - “blind people touch elephants” implies that in front of nature, human cognition is always relatively limited and cannot cover the whole picture, and the fragmented cognitive vision will only make people make partial judgments.<br>There are also a large number of similar metaphors in Western cultural resources:<br>First, “the death of the God of medicine”: there is an insurmountable deep trench between saving the dying and healing the wounded and bringing the dead back to life.<br>Second, Plato’s “cave prisoner”: Although you are on the scene, you may not know the truth.<br>In the contemporary era, the thinker Susan Sontag revived Plato’s metaphor of “prisoner of the cave”, warning people not to be infatuated with the reality in the image space, especially in the medical field. They should not be intoxicated with the virtual world that “is not the real itself but only the real image”, and be wary of the tampering of the world truth by “filming”. This image is not the other image, and there may not be the truth if there is an image, Photography “is both a way to verify experience and a way to reject experience”, “it is both a false presence and a sign of absence”.<br>The flooding of images will cause the “passivation effect” of the doctor’s mind, the attention and sensitivity to suffering will decline, the ability of sympathy and empathy will become weak, and the result of moral numbness is the loss of human nature.<br>Third, “Dr. Lim”: use the third eye to examine the purpose of medicine and the alienated creation.<br>Fourth, “Frankenstein”: doctors cannot and should not act as gods.<br>Fifthly, “slot machines and broken test tubes”: medicine is devouring a lot of money, but it only draws a fragmented picture of life.<br>Sixth, the abnormal number of battlefield Ethics: it is not mutiny, not injury, but success to give a shot to a seriously injured comrade in arms.<br>Rita Cullen, the author of narrative medicine, once asked her father, who was also a doctor, what was the meaning of “Charon” in his name. The old father told him deeply that Charon originally meant “ferryman of the Styx River”. There was a Styx River between life and death. The children of the doctor family were ferrymen crossing the river. The work of ferrymen was not a Jedi counterattack, nor did they turn bad luck into good luck, but to accompany, protect and witness affectionately, Bring magical comfort to the patient and let the patient reconcile with death in company. In company, the companion also finds the meaning of life. In the view of old Karen, a good doctor is not a person who can completely repel disease and death, but a person who can help patients face the threat of disease and death but is still full of courage. The most desperate thing for terminally ill patients is not the disease and pain itself, but an extremely strong sense of abandonment and meaninglessness, which makes them unable to extricate themselves and feel miserable.<br>It is true that in the face of life and death, suffering and temptation, people know the importance and priorities, distinguish interests and gains and losses, but they do not necessarily know advance and retreat, retract and release, and the metaphor of life is recognizable, it is difficult to be open-minded, the cover door of Medicine can be broken, and it is difficult to fully understand, all of which are testing the human spirit of all things.</p>
<p>Section 3 philosophical characteristics and categories of Medicine<br>Diversity of life is different from biodiversity. The truth it wants to reveal is that every life is unique.<br>Because people are not only biological bodies, but also public relations people with complex social interactions, emotional people with rich psychological feelings, but also spirits of all things with spiritual opening and closing. Therefore, the radius of medical technology is larger than that of general technology. General technology pursues rationality, roots, usefulness and effectiveness. In addition to these demands, medical technology must also pursue virtue, emotion, fun and spirit, so that human reason and emotion can be integrated in the communication and exchange with patients, and technology and human nature are in perfect harmony.<br>The essence of medical treatment is not to sell drugs and surgery, but to care for and serve people, care for suffering and comfort death. Patients care not only about how high the hospital building is and how advanced the technology is, but also about whether there is benevolence and humanity in the medical process, whether there is empathy between doctors and patients, whether the medical and nursing staff have empathy and patience, and whether the medical service has temperature.<br>The worship of statistics, the supremacy of evidence, and the loss of objectivism and evidentialism may lead to the biased application of evidence-based medicine.</p>
<p>Section 4 tension between virtue and rationality<br>Max Scheler, a modern German phenomenologist, described “sacredness” as the distillation and arrival of survival value. Scheler believed that human life value has five levels (order), and sacredness is at the peak of spiritual altitude, which is the highest value of human life; At the bottom is the sensory value, and people are always pursuing fitness (comfort) and pleasure; Above it is the use value, calculating the usefulness and uselessness, interests and gains and losses; Above the use value is the value of human life, health or illness, strong or weak, youth or aging, vigorous or depressed; The higher pursuit is people’s spiritual value. People at this value level begin to care about the feelings and experiences of the soul, and know how to distinguish high and low, light and dark, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong, true and false, joy and sadness, like and hate, respect and contempt, enrichment and emptiness; The highest pursuit is the value of soul (Religion), to realize the holiness, to settle the soul, to realize salvation and restore the magnanimity of life through reflection, awe, sadness and repentance.<br>Obviously, Osler has realized that the proverbial declaration is not enough to arouse a lasting sense of professional sanctity, and it is easy to fall into empty shell and knowledge and action (pseudo sanctity). Professional sanctity must be concretized through education and moral internalization must be achieved through ethical life.<br>Moral cultivation is the cultivation of a series of tacit knowledge and skills, which cannot be modeled, standardized, or quickly completed.</p>
<p>Section 5 commitment of modern medicine<br>The three enemies of doctors are ignorance, indifference and depravity.<br>“The medical profession, which appears to be very knowledgeable, is actually a very ignorant profession.” I think to understand this is not to lose confidence and give up exploration, but to lose some people’s fearlessness derived from ignorance, more professional introspection and awe of life, and eliminate a little professional apathy caused by the supremacy of science and the worship of technology.<br>In a sense, understanding medicine means understanding death and reading death. Only by doing this can we graduate from the major course of life.</p>

            <p>What is medicine?</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter I Medicine: Science? Human studies?</p>
<p>Section 1 examination of “medical registration”</p>
<p>Overemphasizing scientificity and scientization may narrow the academic vision of medicine, which is the so-called “cover of modernity” or “loss of Scientism”.<br>In this era of “science” worship. Science, as a knowledge system, has long been ideologized and plated with a too solemn aura. Therefore, the title of science is too much of a stake for the professional group of Medicine - to say who is not science implies a kind of dualistic exclusion thinking. If you are not a scientist, you must be non science, pseudoscience and anti science. This is a fatal “subversion” of professional identity.<br>What is the cost of one-sided scientization and technicalization of medicine? The price is the loss of medical humanism and the order of medical economy. Consumerism prevails. We seem to be used to naming patients with numbers that lack warmth. 35 beds, 42 specimens… Human suffering suddenly turns into cold pathological sections and images; In the hospital, there are rooms full of machines, plus expressionless strange faces; On the one hand, there is a serious shortage of health resources, on the other hand, there is extreme extravagance and waste.<br>Another philosopher who thinks in disease, tooms, pointed out sharply in the meaning of patients: “doctor, you are just observing, and I am experiencing”. She believes that there are “two worlds” in the process of patients. What I experience is pain (the patient’s world), and what you observe is disease (the doctor’s world). Disease and pain are not the same thing. The focus of your observation is disease rather than people, and medicine has forgotten “people”.<br>In fact, there are four types of “treatment” in the professional context: etiological treatment, etiological treatment, symptomatic treatment, and placebo treatment.<br>Trudeau, a famous doctor in the United States, has a famous saying: “sometimes to cure, often to care, always to comfort”. He engraved this sentence on his tombstone.<br>Musen: “although the cognitive content of medicine may be restored to biology, even physics and chemistry, medicine, as a whole discipline, cannot be restored to biology.”<br>Because its scientificity is in the “entanglement” of Humanities and social science knowledge and methods, medicine is no longer just a special technology, a tree of knowledge, a career to make a living, but a career and intellectual life full of pleasure.<br>The second section questions visualism and objectivism<br>Its cognitive root is the objectification, objectification and reductionist thinking of life, which obscures the subjectivity and experience of life activities; Its fatal injury is indifference to painful experience; The unbearable pain is the temperature of losing humanity in the process of diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Section 3 “spiritual black hole” of medicine in the 20th century<br>In fact, this idea that science is naturally clean is harmful. Science does not have the characteristics of natural cleanliness and the function of self moral purification.</p>
<p>Section 4 frontier technology faces serious ethical impact<br>Everyone is immersed in the “drama” of scientific development, competition, conquest, coronation and carnival. Everyone is competing. What is the result of the competition? This technology may completely erase the contingency and diversity of human reproduction. If cloning becomes a routine, there will be no contingency.<br>The consequences of this intervention in life will inevitably lead to the disorder of human relations and biological genealogy.</p>
<p>Section 6 what is traditional Chinese medicine?<br>Traditional Chinese Medicine - because first it is effective, then it is reasonable. It can be effective and unreasonable, of course, it can also be effective and reasonable.<br>At present, the mission of Chinese culture is to return to its roots and create a new one: to return to its roots and revitalize the confidence of national culture; We should also open up a new era and embark on the journey of cultural innovation, and maintain the necessary tension between the two.<br>In the context of the intersection and dialogue between Chinese and Western painting, Mr. Pan Tianshou, a giant of traditional Chinese painting, has the wisdom of “drawing a distance between Chinese and Western painting”. This argument is also of enlightening significance to the future development of traditional Chinese medicine.<br>According to the inertial deduction of its survival and development in the 20th century, the evolution of traditional Chinese medicine has roughly three ways: first, being willing to live in the second class and continue to become complementary / alternative medicine; The second is to devote life experience, early clinical experience, research inspiration and materials to scientific and technological medicine from the west, and become a hypothesis base to be verified; Third, the full publicity of academic subjectivity has made it a Chinese type of medicine, catching up with and surpassing Western types of medicine in some fields (sub-health care, elderly diseases, chronic diseases, disability diagnosis and treatment), and creating new treatment characteristics and market patterns.</p>

            <p>What is medicine?</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Self Preface<br>All possible pain and salvation<br>Medicine has not only numerous technical goals (they are only some phased and local occupational tactics and strategic goals), but also social consensus on disease, pain, disability and health (they are compound occupational strategic goals that transcend Technology), as well as lofty humanitarian vision (they are the starting point and destination of the profession). Perhaps some people will disagree and think that this is a metaphysical dream of medical humanities, It aims to build a Utopia of human health, but we do need a Utopia to lead the eternal pursuit of human health.<br>The current problem is how to completely define the value system of technical objectives, social consensus and humanitarian vision.<br>As a social consensus and humanitarian vision, medicine should not be “the taming and Transcendence of life, old age, disease and death”, but “all possible pain and salvation”. The basic meaning of human happiness is “more happiness, less pain”.</p>
<p>Introduction<br>Eternal questions, eternal puzzles<br>What is medicine? A “luoshengmen” with many different theories.<br>As a common sense, medicine has three basic definitions:<br>The first is the knowledge and skill system of human (animal) physiology - health care, disease - prevention.<br>Second, it is a highly professional academic exploration and service activity, commonly known as “practicing medicine”, whose main body is called “medical scientist”.<br>The third is a part of the knowledge system of natural science, which is called “medical science”.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>According to the research contents, objects and methods, it is divided into three parts: Basic Medicine, clinical medicine and preventive medicine. In addition, there are other disciplines such as military medicine, forensic medicine, aviation medicine, cosmology and nautical medicine.<br>This is the “useful, effective, rational, prescriptive and categorical” (five haves) characteristics of medicine.<br>From this, we get the following two definitions: medical science takes the study of diseases as the object. Medical skill aims to maintain and restore health.<br>The core content (only pedigree) of “medicine” is composed of the basic theory and practice of medicine, including biomedicine, behavioral and Social Sciences, general clinical skills, clinical decision-making skills, communication skills, medical ethics and other modules.<br>Core content of “medicine” (competence pedigree) In addition to the scientific foundation, clinical skills and group health care, the consensus in seven fields is put forward. It also focuses on three abilities that keep pace with the times: communication skills, information management and critical thinking, and takes professional values, attitudes, behaviors and ethics as the core elements of medical students. Here, the professional values of doctors include virtue, altruism, responsibility, compassion, empathy, honesty, integrity, commitment to scientific methods, etc.<br>The academic system of clinical medicine specialty of Peking University Medical College and Peking Union Medical College is eight years. Compared with other medical schools, their first year is the pre medical stage. Students study general natural sciences, social sciences and Humanities at Peking University and Tsinghua University respectively; The last seven years will be the undergraduate stage of medicine. I will study basic medicine and clinical medicine courses in the medical department, medical college and clinical hospital, and complete clinical practice, scientific research training and graduation thesis. Students who have completed all courses according to the regulations and achieved excellent results can obtain the medical doctor’s degree.<br>The first stage: medical preparation stage (two semesters). In addition to foreign languages, politics, humanities, physical education and other public courses, it also includes calculus, inorganic chemistry and analytical chemistry, general biology, geometry and algebra, organic chemistry, college physics, physical chemistry, Fundamentals of computer software technology, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, probability theory and mathematical statistics, microbiology, developmental biology, bioinformatics and other courses.<br>The second stage: basic medicine stage (five semesters), which is conducted in medical schools / basic medical schools and pharmaceutical schools. Courses include human anatomy, histoembryology, physiology, microbiology, parasitology, medical immunology, medical genetics, pathological anatomy, pathophysiology, pharmacology, molecular biology, medical statistics, biophysics, neurobiology, medical literature retrieval, medical psychology, etc.<br>The third stage: clinical medicine stage (including probation, five semesters), in medical school / clinical medical school. Courses include diagnostics, radiation diagnosis, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and Gynecology, pediatrics, neurology and psychiatry, traditional Chinese medicine, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, Stomatology, dermatology, epidemiology and community health, hygiene, nuclear medicine, clinical epidemiology, clinical theory, physical medicine and rehabilitation medicine, clinical pharmacology, social medicine, allergy, clinical oncology, etc.<br>Stage 4: clinical practice and scientific research training (four semesters), of which 8 months before graduation is the time for scientific research training courses. Under the guidance of doctoral tutors, you must independently complete a scientific research topic and pass the oral defense.<br>The value space of medicine has the characteristics of “ladder progression”, the technical function and the basic bottom value of knowledge pedigree, the universal value highlighted by the social public understanding of medicine, and the ultimate value in the sense of human soul settling down are the higher and supreme boundaries of the medical profession.<br>Follow the direction of pragmatism to inquire about the ideal of medicine. The answer is to pursue and maximize medical utilitarianism and functional goals, such as conquering or controlling several acute and malignant diseases endangering human health within a limited time limit, establishing physical and chemical indicators to improve human quality of life and prolong life. The phased goal is to find a number of quick acting and effective new drugs, new operations and new equipment, and implement a number of health regulations and health welfare policies to eliminate diseases, reduce diseases, reduce disabilities and help the disabled, so as to promote human health. The implementation of industry indicators is to systematically improve vocational medical education and public health communication, improve the level of medical research, deeply explore patient mechanisms and solutions, effectively improve the situation of hospitals and doctors, and maximize the growing medical and health care needs of the public.<br>In the face of disease, we can’t know everything. In the face of health, we cannot be perfect. However, we can reflect on the limitations of the times and pursue the best of the times.<br>In fact, the ability to ask questions about a discipline, a profession and an era is by no means a “redundant” appendix, nor is it a “dragon slaying technique”, but the power of thinkers to sharpen their thinking. Therefore, Einstein once said: “raising problems is more important than solving problems”. For anyone with academic and spiritual life, to give up the power of “thinking” is to hand over the power of “questioning”. Once this power is handed over, no matter how the skills are developed, they can only be “craftsmen” whose vision is covered and whose spirit is castrated. It is impossible to make great achievements and innovations in the forefront of disciplines and professions.<br>Thirdly, the medical motif is not all some grand narrative propositions. The technical “category” highlighted at the level of professional operation is also the medical motif, for example:</li>
<li>“Intervention and adaptation”, including: why intervention? What is the cost of intervention? Where is the boundary of intervention? Philosophically, it reveals the unity of opposites of “conquest awe”, “killing symbiosis” and “medical care rescue”;</li>
<li>“Biology and life”: it leads us to distinguish the fundamental distinction between “visible spiritual”, “physiological psychological” and “corpse living”, and to understand the bias between “reductionism” and “vitality”;</li>
<li>“Observation and experience”: including the value collision of “objective subjective”, “disease suffering” and “discovering patients - creating patients”;</li>
<li>“Technology and art”: including the compatibility of “craft craft” and “standardization personalization”;</li>
<li>“Universality and individuality”: including the mutual consistency and compatibility of “internationality - locality”, “Globalization - localization” and “schematization - individualization”;</li>
<li>“Truth and true meaning” and “correctness justice”: it is the philosophical basis for the resurgence of contemporary “medical ethics” and aims to grasp the tension of “objectivity morality”, “reason conscience” and “this shore other shore” (technology and Religion) in medical services.<br>In fact, we should think about speed and realm when dealing with careers, undertakings, and even the advancement of life. We should not think that only “controlling the slow by the fast” is the right way. Sometimes we need a calm attitude of “controlling the fast by the slow”.<br>After thinking about “speed”, we should also consider the quality distinction and height rise and fall between “up” and “down” in the journey. Never “move forward” in the fall.</li>

            <p>Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest in and/or out of the classroom.    (Maximum 350 words）</p>
<p>Biology is the subject which has inspired me the most and I have been interested in this subject since I first learnt it in my junior high school. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not part of my senior High School curriculum, so I decided to do further studies outside the school. My biology course started in a training institution which was a study center of AQA (The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance) and this was the first time I began my interest in this particular subject. During class, I learned about cell structure, human body mechanisms and so on. Apart from focusing on the topics in the textbook, I also discussed derived questions such as why COVID-19 mutates so rapidly with my teacher after class since she was keen on connecting theory with real life.</p>
<p>However, my extracurricular activities were more than that. I read many books in this field such as “The Selfish Gene” (Richard Dawkins, 1976) which was my favorite. From the book, I not only expanded my breadth of knowledge, but also learnt some of the author’s opinions such as “Even if we are all driven by selfish genes, good people will be rewarded” which has developed my critical thinking. </p>
<p>In addition, I went to a biopharmaceutical company and took part in several experiments. These improved my practical skills by learning how to use different experimental apparatus such as a pipette gun in the laboratory. Furthermore, I was invited to join in a project in the company about a new biomedical drug invention. Although I could only take part in a small section of the whole process, I was very pleased to do it since this was a perfect chance for me to see how professional staff can be involved in the production of a new drug which would benefit people suffering from gastroenteritis, which was closely connected to real life.</p>
<p>To summarize, the experience improved my ability to solve problems and come up with new ideas to solve real life dilemmas as well as learning basic knowledge about this career. This will lay the foundation for my broader career choice in the future.</p>

            <p>Today, I wnet to a compamy called 91360 which aims to provide AI technology for assisting pathologic diagnosis, which is called cloud diagnostics and remote consultation of medical care, but I wnat to focus on the first part. This project is TB which means it is towards business which are hospitals.</p>
<p>The company had gotten the first China class III medical device certificate from FDA. It was really hard due to the difficulty of entering this career and scarcity of workers in the specific filed who are called pathologists with at least 10 years’ working experience to be experts. Although they do not contact with patients directly, they need to have the ability to dignose diseases such as what kinds of cancer the patient had by observing cell or tissue sections under light microscope. There is a huge workload since all kinds of cancer cells are different in structures and the number of cells within a small area is so large. However, this technology combines the AI with the dignosing process by converting the physical section of cells into digital image. The algorithm can use the microscpoe and scanner which together form slice scanner inside the system to mark the positions of abnormal cells in the whole area contaning about twenty thousand cells. This offers a easier way for pathologists to screen the cancer cells and make further decisions.</p>
<p>There are two main parts for the promotions of innovation. One is cytology and the other is histology. The main difference between them is use of detathced cells and a piece of tissue though they are both one thin layer of cells. Additionally, the difference also contains  traumatic and atraumatic. It needs to be mentioned that the second method offers a more precise relative position of the tumor.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic information about the mechanism, the technology can not completly replace all pathologists yet as some experts are necessary to face new situations or problems that the computer can not solve. Also, the avalible sample size for the study of AI is small and the accuracy can only get 98% by learning at least 1 million samples. Moreover the knowledge beyond the present cognition of people can not be learned by the AI. In this way, AI is not so good as human brain in innovation although it has better abilities in processing data, integrated presentation and other basic work. Furthermore, the existed laws can not deal with the damage of people caused by AI which means it has some ethical problems.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important thing I learned from the teacher today is the language study. In short, it can help people in many aspects including expression, imgination, analysis, observation and coming up with new idea as well as solution beyond the science Learning.</p>

            <p>What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p>I believe that the skill of playing the piano is my pride and joy. I have played the piano for about 13 years and I started it when I was only 4 years old.</p>
<p>Initially, I just played the piano for pleasure, but now it means much more than that to me. It is true that repeating playing certain melodies everyday was so boring and irritating in the beginning. However, such simple practice was necessary to build up basic skills. I took all the level examinations throughout my piano career, such as Domestic Piano band 10 and ABRSM performance level, but it could be argued those are just methods of testing the standard way of playing different musical pieces from different eras such as the Baroque period.</p>
<p>What attracted me most about playing the piano was the opportunity of performing in front of an audience and learning from others including masters and contestants, which improved both my confidence and vision. I think these competitions and performance experiences have been very important so that I can be who I am now.</p>
<p>I have been to several countries due to my piano playing including the US and Austria but the country which impressed me most was France. There were two reasons for our visit to France. The first was attending master courses and the second was performing at various venues. It is a beautiful and romantic country and I learned a lot about local culture there. When I took part in the course, I learnt specific professional knowledge from the teachers about Jazz and Classical styles. In addition, we gave a charity performance in a church which was peaceful and atmospheric. The audience were so polite and very respectful wearing formal clothes which was pleasing. Therefore, I enjoyed playing the piano in that environment since people showed respect to me.</p>
<p>Although I have decided not to go down the professional road of music, it is a kind of invisible power to support me through difficulties and make me persist in improving my piano technique.</p>

<p>When I was in the sixth grade of primary school, I took part in a printmaking competition called “Lotus Race”. The purpose of the competition was to choose excellent works of art based on their originality from primary school pupils and exhibit them in an art museum near the Nanjing Library.</p>
<p>I was encouraged to take part by my art teacher since I was a member of the printmaking club in our school. In addition, I was also interested in drawing at that time, so I decided to have a try.</p>
<p>In preparation for the first draft, I drew with a 6B pencil which had a darker color for leaving a mark on the sponge paper under the draft and a piece of 4K paper which was about twice the size of A4 paper. At the start of the process, I was not sure what to draw however, I suddenly came up with a good idea which was to draw a robot. In 2015, robots seemed to be gradually appearing in people’s lives, used for activities such as sweeping, guiding the general public to various destinations like in Nanjing and robots who help in the kitchen. I thought that they could help people in many ways as fabulous assistants since I wanted to create more opportunities for robots to help humans, so I focused on firefighting. It was not an unrealistic idea as I discovered that forest fires occurred frequently because of dry weather in various areas of China. If there was a robot to help, it could be easier since the robots could be controlled remotely and firefighters could avoid the dangers of being close to fierce fires.</p>
<p>After some creative thinking, my first draft of the design was finished. The robot had a big square head for scanning and patrolling, eight long legs with wheels for fast movement and the fire extinguishing system in its body. Although I was still young, which meant some details were not precise enough, I tried my best to make the scene look realistic by drawing a background which showed the robot putting out the fire of buildings in a busy city center with spray pipes.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I won a prize and my work was shown in the exhibition. It was an impressed experience as it inspired me to use my creativity to contribute to the society in the future. Just as the saying goes “creativity comes from life.”</p>
