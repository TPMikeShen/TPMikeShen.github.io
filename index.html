            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 5 aggressive behavior: stable and selfish machines<br>Most members of the population adopt a certain strategy, and the benefits of this strategy are inferior to other strategies. This strategy is evolutionary stability strategy or ess. This concept is both subtle and important. In other words, for individuals, the best strategy depends on what most members of the population are doing. Since the rest of the population is also composed of individuals, and they all try to maximize their achievements, what can persist must be a strategy: once it is formed, the strategy of any individual with abnormal behavior can not be compared with it. After a big change in the environment, there may be a short stage of evolutionary instability in the population, or even fluctuations. But once an ESS is established, it will stabilize: deviation from ess will be punished by natural selection.<br>At first glance, this situation sounds a bit like group selection, but it has nothing in common with group selection. The reason why this situation sounds like group selection is that it reminds us of a population in a stable equilibrium. Whenever this equilibrium is broken, the population can often gradually return to this equilibrium. However, ESS is a far more subtle concept than group selection. It has nothing to do with the fact that some groups are more successful than others.<br>Chapter 6 Genetic race<br>When we calculate the kinship index, we need to further adjust the concise symmetric calculus. In terms of genetics, grandparents and grandchildren treat each other with altruistic behavior for the same reason, because a quarter of their genes are common. However, if the life expectancy of grandchildren is longer, the genes that manipulate the altruistic behavior of grandparents have better selection conditions than the genes that manipulate the altruistic behavior of grandchildren to grandparents. The net benefit from assisting a young distant relative is likely to exceed the net benefit from assisting an old close relative (by the way, the life expectancy of grandparents is certainly not necessarily shorter than that of grandchildren). In species with high infant mortality, the opposite may be true).<br>If we want to program a computer to simulate how a typical survival machine makes decisions about whether to behave altruistic behavior, we should probably do this: make a list of all the behaviors that the animal may do, and then program a weighted calculus for each mode of these behaviors. All kinds of interests are given a positive sign and all kinds of risks are given a negative sign. Then it is weighted, that is, each benefit and risk are multiplied by an appropriate index indicating kinship. Then add up the figures. For the convenience of calculation, we don’t consider the weights of other aspects such as age and health status at the beginning. Since an individual’s kinship index to himself is 1 (that is, he has 100% of his own genes - it is self-evident), there is no need to discount all his risks and interests, that is, give full weight in the calculation. In this way, the sum of each possible behavior pattern is roughly as follows: the net benefit of the behavior pattern = benefit to oneself - risk to oneself + 1 / 2 benefit to Brothers - 1 / 2 risk to brothers + 1 / 2 benefit to another brother - 1 / 2 risk to another brother + 1 / 8 benefit to cousins - 1 / 8 risk to cousins + 1 / 2 benefit to children - 1 / 2 risk to children +<br>We can therefore conclude that in terms of the evolution of altruistic behavior, the importance of “real” kinship may not be as important as animals can estimate kinship. To understand this fact, we can understand why parental love is much more common and sincere than altruistic behavior between brothers / sisters in nature, and why its own interests are even more important to animals than several brothers. In short, I mean, in addition to the kinship index, we should also consider the “certainty” index. Although the parent / child relationship is not closer than the brother / sister relationship in the sense of genetics, it is much more positive. In general, it is not as easy to be sure who is your brother as to be sure who is your child. As for who you are, it’s easier to be sure.<br>There is another asymmetry in parent-child relationships, which does not apply to brother / sister relationships. Children are always younger than their parents, which often, if not forever, means that children have a longer life expectancy. As I emphasized above, life expectancy is an important variable. In the most ideal environment, an animal should consider this variable in “calculus” to “decide” whether it needs to show altruistic behavior. In species where children’s average life expectancy is longer than that of their parents, any gene that manipulates children’s altruistic behavior will be at a disadvantage, because the beneficiaries of altruistic self sacrifice manipulated by these genes are older and nearer the age of the altruists themselves. On the other hand, in terms of life expectancy in the equation, the genes that manipulate parental altruistic behavior are in a relatively favorable position.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 3 the immortal double helix<br>A DNA molecule is a long chain of building blocks called nucleotides. Just as protein molecules are amino acid chains, DNA molecules are nucleotide chains. DNA is too small to be seen by the naked eye, but its exact shape has been cleverly revealed by human indirectly. It is composed of a pair of nucleotide chains. The two chains interweave each other in an elegant spiral shape, which is called “double helix” or “immortal helix”. There are only four kinds of nucleotide components, which can be referred to as a, t, C and G for short. In all animals and plants, the four are the same, but the difference is the order in which they intertwine.<br>Another aspect of gene graininess is that it does not age, and even a gene that has lived for one million years is not more likely to die than a partner that has only lived for 100 years. It transfers from one individual to another generation by generation, and controls one individual after another in its own way to achieve its own goal; It abandons dying individuals before they fall into aging and death.<br>Chapter 4 gene machine<br>Like Andromeda, genes can only do their best to deploy everything in advance, build a fast-moving computer for themselves, make them master the laws of as many situations as genes can “expect”, and give “advice” for this. But life is as unpredictable as chess. It is unrealistic to foresee everything in advance. Like the programmers of chess games, the “instructions” of genes to the survival machine can not be specific and subtle, it can only be the general strategy and various tips for livelihood.<br>In a complex world, there are certain risks in making predictions about the future., Every decision of the survival machine is a gambling behavior. Genes have the responsibility to program the brain in advance so that the decisions made by the brain can achieve positive results. In the evolutionary casino, the chip is survival, strictly speaking, the survival of genes. But in order to be reasonable, the general similar statement can also be individual survival.<br>Every time a contact system comes into being, there is always a risk that some creatures will use the system for their own benefit. Because we have been influenced by the evolutionary view of “species interests”, we naturally think that liars and cheaters belong to different species: predators, prey animals, parasites and so on. However, when there is a conflict of interests between different individuals’ genes, it is inevitable that there will be such behaviors as lying, cheating and selfish communication. This includes different individuals belonging to the same species. We will see that even children cheat their parents, husbands cheat their wives, and brothers cheat each other.<br>Some people believe that animal contact signals were originally developed for mutual benefit, but later used by bad elements. After all, this idea is too naive. The actual situation is likely to be: from the beginning, all animal contact behaviors are mixed with some kind of fraud, because all animals have to involve at least some kind of conflict of interest when they interact with each other.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text<br>Chapter 1 Why would anyone?<br>It is of course beneficial for me to use the method of reduction to absurdity to demonstrate and reveal the dilemma that the theory of group selection can not justify itself, but the obvious altruistic behavior of individuals still needs to be explained.<br>My belief is deeply influenced by Williams’ great book adaptation and natural selection. The central point I want to use can be traced back to the late 19th century and the early 20th century, when Weisman’s “continuity of the germplasms” theory predicted today’s development. The basic unit of choice that I will demonstrate, that is, the basic unit of self-interest, is neither species nor group, nor even individual, strictly speaking, but genetic unit gene.<br>Chapter 2 Replicator<br>The hemoglobin in our blood is a typical protein molecule. It consists of smaller molecules, chains of amino acids, each containing dozens of atoms arranged precisely. There are 574 amino acid molecules in the hemoglobin molecule, which are arranged into four intertwined chains to form a solid sphere. The complexity of its structure is really dazzling. A model of hemoglobin molecule looks like a dense Tribulus terrestris, but it is different from a real Tribulus terrestris. It is not a random approximate model, but a fixed structure. This structure is repeated more than 60 trillion times in the human body, and its structure is exactly the same. Hemoglobin, a protein molecule like Tribulus terrestris, is stable in shape. That is to say, its two pairs of chains composed of amino acids with the same sequence tend to form exactly the same three-dimensional coiled structure like two springs. In the human body, hemoglobin tribulus forms their “favorite” shape at the rate of about 400 trillion per second, while other hemoglobin is destroyed at the same rate.<br>Today, they live together in groups, live in the giant “robot” body, separate from the outside world, connect with the outside world through indirect circuitous ways, and control the outside world through remote control. They exist in you and me, they create us, they create our bodies and minds, and preserving them is the ultimate reason for our existence. These replicators have a long history. Today, we call them genes, and we are their survival machines.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p><em>Catalogue</em><br>Chapter 1 Why are there people?<br>Curious children often ask, “Why are there people?” Darwin enabled us to give a practical answer to this question. Is life meaningful? What is the purpose of life? What is human? In the face of these profound problems, we no longer need to turn to the supernatural.<br>Chapter 2 replication factors<br>They exist in you and me, they create us, they create our bodies and minds, and preserving them is the ultimate reason for our existence. These replicators have a long history. Today, we call them genes, and we are their survival machines.<br>Chapter 3 the immortal double helix<br>DNA is too small to be seen by the naked eye, but its exact shape has been cleverly revealed by human indirectly. It is composed of a pair of nucleotide chains. The two chains interweave with each other in an elegant spiral shape, which is called “double helix” or “immortal helix”.<br>Chapter 4 gene machine<br>Polar bear genes can be sure to know in advance that their unborn survival machine will face a cold environment. This prediction is not the result of genetic thinking. They don’t think: they’re just prepping a thick coat of fur, because in some previous bodies, they always did.<br>Chapter 5 aggressive behavior: the machine of stability and selfishness<br>For the survival machine, the logical strategy seems to be to kill its competitors and then better eat them. Although massacre and cannibalism occur in nature, it is a naive understanding of selfish gene theory that this phenomenon is widespread.<br>Chapter 6 gene race<br>According to Hamilton’s theory of heredity, we can easily explain the feud between clans and the fight between families. Incest taboo shows that human beings have a deep sense of kinship, although the genetic benefits of incest taboo have nothing to do with altruism. It is probably related to the harmful effects of recessive genes produced by inbreeding.<br>Chapter 7 family planning<br>The reason why individuals regulate the number of eggs in their nests is not the motivation of altruism. They will not implement birth control in order to avoid excessive consumption of group resources. Their goal of birth control is to maximize the survival of their existing children, which runs counter to our original goal of birth control.<br>Chapter 8 the battle of generations<br>It’s a delicate fight, with both sides going all out and not bound by any rules. Children use every opportunity to cheat. It will pretend to be more hungry than it is, maybe younger than it is, or face greater danger than it is. On the other hand, parents should be alert to such deception and try their best to avoid being cheated.<br>Chapter 9 gender war<br>In view of the fact that sperm is easy to lose, male fish must wait until the female spawns before ejaculating on the egg. But in this way, the female fish has a rare few seconds to slip away and leave the fertilized eggs in the care of the male fish, putting them in what trevors calls a dilemma.<br>Chapter 10 you itch for me, I’ll ride on your head<br>Suppose B has a parasite on its head, and a removes it. Soon after, a had parasites on his head. Of course, a went to B, hoping that B would get rid of them in return. As a result, B sniffed and turned around. B is a swindler. This swindler accepts the favor of others, but he is not grateful.<br>Chapter 11 finding the mother: a new replicator<br>I think a new type of replicator has recently emerged on our planet. It’s right in front of us, but it’s still in its infancy, still clumsily drifting in its original soup. But it’s pushing the evolutionary process so fast that the original factor is out of reach. This new soup is the soup of human culture.<br>Chapter 12 a good man is rewarded<br>The number of good people is doomed to decrease, and goodness will eventually perish in Darwinism. There is another special explanation for “good man” here, which is not far from the meaning in the common saying. But in this kind of explanation, good people can “get what they want.”.<br>Chapter 13 gene extension<br>We can further infer that genes in one organism can have extended phenotypic effects on another. Genes escape from their own bodies and manipulate the outside world.<br>Chapter 14 gene determinism and gene selection<br>For centuries, philosophers and theologians have been debating whether determinism is correct and whether it is related to a person’s moral responsibility for his own actions.<br>Chapter 15 restriction on Perfection<br>The animals we see today may be “out of date”, and the genes that affect the establishment process were selected at an earlier time to cope with different conditions.</p>

            <p>  Last week, our Jinling A-level center organized a visit to Lishui special agricultural education base. We stayed there for three days and learned many useful agricultural knowledge. Although it rained sometimes and was so hot, we kept on doing activities. Since we did a large number of activities, I prefer to choose some which impressed me most during that time.</p>
<p>  The first one was planting chrysanthemum. It was not as simple as we had thought. We needed to use the hoe to  scarify the soil and let the rain flow away without flooding. Then, we used the Shovel to dig a hole with proper size to put the seedling. Finally, we watered them with the watering pot.</p>
<p>  The second one was grounding soybean milk. We were divided into several groups to do this. Every group had a stone mill, a bowl of soybean, a basin of water and a brush. The process was more difficult and tedious. Firstly, pour in some soybean and add water. Next, turn the mill counter anticlockwise at a high speed. Then, pour the slurry into the stone mill and grind it again until it becomes thinner. After that, pour all the slurry into a big gauze funnel in order to get purer soy milk. Finally, heat the soy milk and add some white granulated sugar. We all tasted the finished product, which was unexpectedly delicious.</p>
<p>  The last one was cuttaging green vines. This project tested our patience and carefulness. We wet nutrient soil in the beginning and put two thirds of the volume of the flowerpot in the flowerpot. Then, the most important step came. Cut the cane vines of the green vines and cut their stems obliquely in order to absorb more nutrition. What’s more, we needed to keep three branches and make them upwards when inserting the soil. Finally, add some dry soil and water it throughout. It did take us a long time to do these.</p>
<p>  Furthermore, we got the chance to watch fireworks luckily as it is banned in the city. We really learned a lot from this visit and had a good time with our classmates, teachers and instructors.</p>

            <p>​                                                                          A personal goal</p>
<p>​    At Jinling High School, my personal goal was to work hard enough to be able to apply to study Biomedicine at university. This was because I would like to be a doctor or some other jobs related to this field in the future. My college counsellor had emphasized how important it was to choose the right course to allow a future, successful career. </p>
<p>​    When I set this goal, my mother and college counselor both did something helpful. First of all when my mother knew my goal, she started to find suitable extra-curricular activities immediately since there is no biology course in our school. She helped me get to the class with some other students in my school. It is true that learning Biology is not easy, especially in English, since it requires you to master a large number of rare words and many basic principles that are difficult to understand, but I am working hard on it as I do need the academic knowledge first in order to pass the A-level biology examination. In addition, it can help me take part in competitions like IBO and BBO which are useful when I apply for university since they will let the University feel that I am more able to learn the course well. Additionally, my college counselor recommended some books on biology to me, such as ‘The Selfish Gene’ and ‘Talk to the Disease - general practitioner’s notes’. After reading them, I seemed to have opened the door to a new world. Apart from gaining useful knowledge from the books, I also really enjoyed myself learning through reading which was also relaxing. </p>
<p>​    Furthermore, reading these books can expand my knowledge in this field and let me have a deeper understanding about it. In fact, since I set this goal, my learning schedule has become busy, but it has also enriched my everyday life. Through this, I learned that to achieve my goal, I must make unremitting efforts and every step is very important. </p>
<p>​    So far, I am still working hard for my long-term goal, although it is difficult to apply for this major since few students have succeeded in entering this field before, I will never give up, because it is my dream.</p>

            <p>  Yesterday, I took part in a volunteer work called <em>Big hand holding small hand, love helping growth</em>, which took place in Jiangxinzhou Zhoutai community. The purpose of the activity was to help the families which had difficulty in education and living solve their problems and donate some stationeries and books to them.</p>
<p>  The leader was a network reporter who had organized many similar activities before. We went into the first part which allowed volunteer parents to share their experience about education at home with those parents who were in need from the community. Several mothers talked in the beginning since in most families, they played important roles in education and tutoring children. Later, a few fathers talked about how they helped with the home education as the leader asked them to do so.</p>
<p>  We, Jinling High School students, also said something about how to study in primary school and gave some advice. Maybe the children couldn’t understand what we meant, bur the parents really benefited a lot.</p>
<p>  Finally, we gave them our gifts as well as blessing cards. What I wrote on the card was that “Life is difficult, but as long as you work hard, you will see the rainbow after the rain; as long as you are tenacious, you can always overcome difficulties and obstacles, pass the exam; as long as you persist, you will realize your dream and succeed in your studies. Learn to face, learn to accept, learn to change, learn to grow. You will certainly be able to change your destiny, be masters of your own destiny and realize your life value. May you live each day in peace and happiness!”</p>
<p>  This was really a meaningful volunteer work.</p>

            <p>  My name is Shen Ziyou and my English name is Mike. I am a 16-year-old student in Jinglin High School and hoping to go to university to study biochemistry in when I pass my exams in 2022. I have a big family, but I live with my parents in Nanjing. Furthermore, I have many hobbies, such as playing the piano, playing badminton and listening to music. Moreover, in my free time, I like reading books too, in particular, science fiction. Sometimes, I also read some classic works and literature novels such as <em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>
<p>   In my mother’s eyes, I am not an extrovert or an active boy before other people, but I always focus on what I am doing and I am not talkative. I can do things well because of my patience and carefulness. I am very persistent and determined. For instance, I have been practicing playing the piano and devoting most of my time to it for almost twelve years. As a result, I have a useful skill which someone else may not have and I believe that it will help my life in some way one day. On the other hand, in my friends’ opinions, maybe I am shy and seldom talk to others, but I get on well with people I know well and can trust. </p>
<p>   I am very proud of an activity I took part in at Primary School when I was a child. In the beginning, my classmates and I were put into groups and asked to pick up rubbish on the streets. Around our school, there were so much garbage, such as plastic bottles, cigarette butts and packing paper. I had thought that it would not take us much time to clean several streets, however, unexpectedly, we were doing this the whole morning until 12 o’clock that day. Because of this, we were all tired out and wanted to lie on the ground at once when we finished! Through this activity, I not only learnt that this is not easy work, but also realized the importance of protecting the environment. Most importantly, it was the first time that I did something to help society with my own hands. </p>
<p>   In conclusion, this was an unforgettable experience because it was meaningful and Inspiring. This taught me excellent skills for my future such as teamworking and improving my communication skills.</p>

            <p>  Last Wednesday, our Jinling International Center held an activity called <em>Talk to the workplace and meet the future</em>. Our school invited many successful parents to introduce different kinds of fields for us. This would help us find what we are interested in and what we need to work hard on.</p>
<p>  I attended the lecture about material science. Teacher Ma first made a general introduction about the topic. From the lecture, I have known that the material can be generally divided in two ways which are nature and function. According to the first way, materials can be divided into three kinds that are polymer materials, metal materials and inorganic nonmetallic materials. According to the second way, materials can also be divided into three kinds that are structural materials, functional materials and biological materials. Use the inorganic nonmetallic materials as an example, it has common materials like concrete and ceramics. Nowadays, the material science is everywhere in our daily life. Actually, we can use a special  kind of material to make our mobile phones which can make them lighter. Go further, we can reduce the expansion coefficient of rail to reduce the noise made by high-speed rail. Hydrogen storage material is a popular project now as if we make it, we can use more pollution free hydrogen energy. In order to achieve this, we first need the technology called solid fusion which can mix solids just like liquids. This can improve the strength of the material. Another is called new ceramics. By firing the SiC particles, carbon fiber can be toughened. Beyond the visible materials, the scientists are applying to research materials in microcosmic by electron microscopes. Overall, the material science is all about the component, structure, performance and machining of materials.</p>
<p>  After the main topic, Teacher Ma also introduced something about Neurology and Psychiatry. Most of us believe that depression is a mental illness. However, he said that it is caused by autonomic nervous disorder in the nervous system. Because of this, neurotransmitters will not be secreted properly. Then, it will lead to depression finally. To our surprise, he said that it can be easily cured by pricking your fingers. He explained that this can get the nervous system back to normal. We couldn’t believe that at first, but he told us that some people had done that and had been cured of such illness. I think that some of what he said are true, but the other things have to be done further research.</p>
<p>  I benefited a lot from the lecture in deed. I hope our school will held more activities like this.</p>
