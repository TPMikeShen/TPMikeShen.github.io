            <p>Describe an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p> In 2020, shortly after my IGCE exams, teachers and parents cooperated to organize a professional experience in the workplace, which let my classmates and I find our interests in future careers such as banking, network technology researcher, medicine and learn more about the work content in detail.</p>
<p>There were eight choices and these included Agricultural Bank of China, Network Technology Company, work experience in a dental hospital and so on. I was interested in a job related to biology and health, moreover I dreamt of becoming a doctor, so I chose the dental hospital placement.</p>
<p>Dentists use a lot of new technology and one area we studied was digital scanning which is used for oral modeling. The scanner transmitted the real-time oral image to the computer which automatically generated the tooth model immediately. As the dentist manipulated the scanner in her hand, she adjusted the image on the computer to make it complete. I realized that nowadays, almost every job uses computer technology which is something I learnt on this work placement. Then, training was given in plaque staining and scientific brushing. After rinsing with water, red edible dye showed teeth with soft debris. When the leading dentist worked with a student to give a demonstration of how to brush teeth in the right way, she did every step carefully in order to avoid any mistakes and was very thorough in her instructions which was helpful for learning quickly. Compared with doing surgical operations, this is simpler and less stressful. A dentist needs to communicate with his patients patiently to make sure everything goes well. I discovered that a clear mind is also very important for most activities in life! Additionally, a calm mind can ensure that timely remedial measures will quickly come to mind and avoid irreparable consequences, such as sequelae of the patient.</p>
<p>I benefited a lot from this visit and discovered that I am suitable for this kind of work which requires patience and care. Furthermore, I need to put more effort into the study of computer programming since it appears to be very important in this field.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                        SHEN ZIYOU</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 11 finding mother: new replication factors<br>But do we have to go to the distant universe to find other kinds of replication factors and other kinds of subsequent evolutionary phenomena? I think a new type of replication factor has recently appeared on our planet. It was right in front of us, but it was still in its infancy and awkwardly drifting in its original soup. But it is driving the process of evolution, and the speed is beyond the reach of the original factors.<br>This new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for this new replication factor. The name should be able to express the concept of a cultural communication unit or imitation unit“ The word “mimeme” comes from a proper Greek root, but I want a monosyllabic word that sounds a bit like “gene”. If I shorten the word “mimeme” to meme, I hope my classical friends will forgive me more. We can think that memory is related to memory or French m ê me, if it can make some people feel a little comfort. This word should rhyme with “cream”.<br>As my colleague N.K. Humphrey pointed out brilliantly when he summarized the content of the first draft of this chapter: “finding a mother should be regarded as a viable structure, which is not only a metaphor, but also academic. When you transplant a viable mother seeking into my heart, in fact, you turn my brain into the mother seeking host and make it a tool to spread the mother seeking, just like the genetic mechanism of a virus parasitic on a host cell. This is not just out of thin air. For example, the mother of “spiritual belief after death” can actually become material. As a structure in the nervous system of people all over the world, it obtains material power millions of times. “<br>Let’s study the concept of “God”. We don’t know how it was first produced in the mother seeking library. It probably appeared after many independent “mutation” processes. Anyway, the concept of “God” is really very old. How does it replicate itself? It is reproduced and spread through oral words and written words with the help of great music and great art. Why does it have such high survival value? You should remember that the “survival value” here does not mean the value of genes in the gene pool, but the value of looking for mothers in the mother pool. The real meaning of this question is what gives the stability and permeability of the concept of “God” in the cultural environment. The survival value of God’s mother seeking library comes from its strong psychological appeal“ The concept of “God” provides a seemingly plausible answer to some profound and distressing questions about survival. It implies that all kinds of unfairness in this world can be corrected in the afterlife. God stretched out his “eternal arms” to bear our human defects, just like a placebo prescribed by doctors for patients, which will also produce certain effects due to spiritual effects. This is part of the reason why God is accepted by people and copied and spread in people’s minds from generation to generation. We can say that in the environment provided by human culture, the image of God exists in the form of mother seeking with high survival value or appeal.<br>Broadly speaking, mother seeking replicates herself by imitation. But just as not all genes that can replicate themselves are good at self replication, some mothers in the mother searching library can achieve greater success than others. This process is similar to natural selection. I have listed some characteristics that help to improve the survival value of mother seeking. But generally speaking, these characteristics must be the same as those of replication factors mentioned in Chapter 2: longevity, fecundity and precise replication ability. Relatively speaking, it may not be important whether any mother seeking copy can live long, which is the same for a gene copy.<br>We need not seek the general biological survival value of various characteristics such as religion, music and sacrificial dance, although these values may also exist. Once a gene provides its survival machine with a brain capable of rapid imitation, the mother will automatically take over. We don’t even have to assume that imitation has some genetic superiority, although it will certainly bring convenience. The essential condition is that the brain should be able to imitate: then there will be a mother seeking to make full use of this ability.<br>Human beings may also have an extraordinary feature - the ability to show sincere and selfless altruistic behavior. I only wish so, but I am not going to debate this in any form, nor do I intend to speculate whether this feature can be attributed to the evolution of mother seeking. What I want to explain is that even if we focus on the dark side and assume that people are basically selfish, our conscious foresight - the ability to simulate the future in imagination - can prevent ourselves from conniving at blind replication factors to do the worst and excessive selfish acts. We have at least the spiritual strength to take care of our long-term selfish interests, not just short-term selfish interests. We can see the long-term benefits of participating in the “pigeon group”, and we can sit down and discuss ways to make the group successful. We have enough strength to resist our innate selfish genes. When necessary, we can also resist the selfish mother seeking instilled in our minds. We can even discuss how to carefully cultivate pure and selfless altruism, which has no place in nature and is unprecedented in the whole world history. We are built as genetic machines and trained as mother seeking machines, but we have enough strength to oppose our founders. In this world, only we, human beings, can resist the tyranny of selfish replication factors.<br>Chapter 12 a good man is rewarded<br>No one would think of bacteria as a conscious strategist, but parasitic bacteria seamlessly interact with their hosts in a prisoner’s dilemma. There is no reason not to use Axelrod’s Theory - kindness, tolerance, no jealousy, etc. to study their strategies. Axelrod and Hamilton pointed out that harmless and beneficial bacteria can become harmful or even fatal sepsis when people are injured. Doctors will say that the body’s “natural resistance” will decline when injured. But perhaps the real reason is the game of prisoner’s dilemma. In the human body, do bacteria gain and constantly test their returns? In the game between human body and bacteria, the “shadow of the future” is usually very long, because an ordinary person can live for many years at any starting point. However, a seriously injured person may bring a short future to its parasitic bacteria“ The temptation of betrayal is suddenly more attractive than the reward of mutual cooperation. Of course, bacteria don’t count these things in their evil little heads! The natural selection of generations of bacteria has cultivated them into an unconscious organism. The primary task is to maintain life by biochemistry.<br>Vampire bats are mysterious. For fans of Victorian Gothic novels, they are often dark forces that intimidate others at night, suck blood and sacrifice innocent lives to meet their selfish desires. In addition, other Victorian mysterious events and bats’ naturally bright red teeth and claws, aren’t blood sucking ghost bats the embodiment of the most frightening power of nature’s selfish genes? I scoff at these mysterious events. If we want to know the truth behind an event, we need to study it. What Darwinism gives us is not a detailed description of a particular creature, but a more subtle but valuable tool: the understanding of principles. If we must add a mysterious event, it is the truth - the story of the noble character of vampire bats. For bats themselves, blood is not thicker than water. They transcend kinship and form their long-term and solid ties among loyal friends. Vampire bats can tell a new mystery story, a story about sharing, mutual assistance and cooperation. They show this kind thought: even if we are all at the helm of selfish genes, good people will be rewarded.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 9  Gender war<br>Therefore, we can see that there are two opposite sexual “strategies” evolving. One is a massive investment or “honest” strategy. This strategy naturally opens the way for small investment, exploitative or “cunning” strategies. Once the two strategies start to run away from each other, it will continue like a runaway horse. Intermediates between these two volumes are punished because they do not have the advantages of either of these two extreme strategies. Cunning gametes become smaller and smaller, more and more flexible. Honest gametes have evolved larger and larger to compensate for the shrinking investment of cunning gametes, and become inflexible. Anyway, cunning gametes will always actively pursue them. Each honest gamete “would rather” fuse with another honest gamete, but the pressure of natural selection to repel cunning gametes is weaker than the pressure to drive them to exploit loopholes: because cunning gametes must win in this evolutionary battle, otherwise they will lose a lot. So honest gametes become eggs, and cunning gametes become sperm.<br>For simplicity, I illustrate the problem with the swing of the pendulum. In fact, the pendulum will never swing so much in the direction in which the female is absolutely dominant. Because once the sex ratio is unbalanced, the natural selection pressure of having a son will begin to push the pendulum back. The strategy of having the same number of children is an evolutionary stability strategy, that is, all genes that deviate from this strategy will suffer a net loss.<br>Chapter 10  If you scratch me, I’ll ride on your head<br>From the point of view of our current topic, slavery has had an interesting consequence. In the species that capture slaves, the queen can make the sexual proportion develop in the direction of its “like”. This is because its own children, that is, the ants who catch slaves, no longer have the real power to manage the nursery, which is now in the hands of slaves. These slaves “thought” that they were taking care of their own flesh and blood brothers or sisters. What they did was almost the same as what they had to do in their own cave, so as to achieve the 3:1 ratio in favor of sisters they hoped to achieve. But the queen, who specializes in the species of slave captivity, can take various countermeasures and successfully reverse this trend. Natural selection acting on slaves cannot counteract these countermeasures because they are not related to the larvae.<br>Human beings have developed good long-term memory and individual recognition ability. Therefore, we can expect altruism to play an important role in human evolution. Trivers goes further. He implies that human psychological characteristics such as jealousy, guilt, gratitude and compassion are formed through natural selection in order to improve the ability of deception, anti deception and avoiding being regarded as a liar. What is particularly interesting is that there is a kind of cunning liar. They seem to be mutually beneficial and altruistic, but they always get more and pay less. The characteristics of human swollen brain and good at rational calculation may even evolve with more and more sophisticated deception and more powerful anti deception mechanism.<br>When we apply the concept of reciprocal altruistic behavior to our own species, we can make endless and intriguing speculation about the possible consequences of this concept. Although I also want to talk about my own views, my imagination is no better than yours. Let readers entertain themselves!</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 7 Family Planning<br>If the mixed strategies of raising and bearing can adapt to the specific ecological conditions of species, they can be evolutionarily stable. A simple upbringing policy cannot be evolutionarily stable. If all individuals devote all their energy to raising existing young children, so that even a new individual does not produce, such a population will soon be invaded by mutant individuals skilled in fertility. Parenting can achieve evolutionary stability only as part of a hybrid strategy - at least a certain amount of reproductive activity is required.<br>According to this chapter, we come to the conclusion that the parents implement family planning in order to keep their birth rate at the most appropriate value. They try to keep their children alive as much as possible, which means they can’t have too many or too few children. Genes that allow individuals to have too many offspring are difficult to survive in the gene pool for a long time, because offspring carrying such genes are difficult to survive to adulthood.<br>Chapter 8 Intergenerational war<br>Parental investment is defined as “any form of investment made by the parent to the individual of the offspring, which increases the opportunity for the individual to survive (and thus successfully reproduce), but at the expense of the parent’s ability to invest in other individuals of the offspring.”<br>We compare animals to survival machines. Their behavior seems to have a “purpose” to preserve their own genes. In this way, we can talk about the contradiction between parents and offspring, that is, the struggle between the two generations. This is a delicate struggle. Both sides go all out and are not bound by any rules and regulations. Children use every opportunity to cheat. It will pretend to be more hungry than it really is, perhaps younger than it really is or facing greater danger than it really is. Although children are young and weak and unable to bully their parents, they do not hesitate to use all available psychological and tactical weapons - lying, cajoling, deceiving, using, and even abusing their kinship to act against their relatives. On the other hand, parents must be alert to such deception and try their best to avoid being deceived. It doesn’t seem difficult to do this.<br>What is discussed in this chapter and in the following chapter (we will discuss conflicts between spouses) seems to be a bit of a terrible irony. As human beings, parents treat each other sincerely and care for their children so meticulously. Therefore, these two chapters may even bring unspeakable pain to parents all over the world. Here, I must state once again that everything I say does not involve conscious motivation. No one believes that children deliberately and consciously deceive their parents because they have selfish genes. At the same time, I must reiterate that when I say “a child should take every opportunity to deceive… Lie, cheat, use…”, my so-called “should” has a special meaning. I don’t think such behavior is ethical and desirable. I just want to explain that natural selection is often beneficial to young children who show this behavior. Therefore, when we observe wild populations, we should not be surprised to see deception and selfish behavior among family members“ The expression “children should cheat” means that the genes that promote children to cheat are in a dominant position in the gene pool. If there is any profound implication for human beings to learn from, it is that we must instill the virtue of altruism into the minds of our children, because we can’t expect altruism in their nature.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 5 aggressive behavior: stable and selfish machines<br>Most members of the population adopt a certain strategy, and the benefits of this strategy are inferior to other strategies. This strategy is evolutionary stability strategy or ess. This concept is both subtle and important. In other words, for individuals, the best strategy depends on what most members of the population are doing. Since the rest of the population is also composed of individuals, and they all try to maximize their achievements, what can persist must be a strategy: once it is formed, the strategy of any individual with abnormal behavior can not be compared with it. After a big change in the environment, there may be a short stage of evolutionary instability in the population, or even fluctuations. But once an ESS is established, it will stabilize: deviation from ess will be punished by natural selection.<br>At first glance, this situation sounds a bit like group selection, but it has nothing in common with group selection. The reason why this situation sounds like group selection is that it reminds us of a population in a stable equilibrium. Whenever this equilibrium is broken, the population can often gradually return to this equilibrium. However, ESS is a far more subtle concept than group selection. It has nothing to do with the fact that some groups are more successful than others.<br>Chapter 6 Genetic race<br>When we calculate the kinship index, we need to further adjust the concise symmetric calculus. In terms of genetics, grandparents and grandchildren treat each other with altruistic behavior for the same reason, because a quarter of their genes are common. However, if the life expectancy of grandchildren is longer, the genes that manipulate the altruistic behavior of grandparents have better selection conditions than the genes that manipulate the altruistic behavior of grandchildren to grandparents. The net benefit from assisting a young distant relative is likely to exceed the net benefit from assisting an old close relative (by the way, the life expectancy of grandparents is certainly not necessarily shorter than that of grandchildren). In species with high infant mortality, the opposite may be true).<br>If we want to program a computer to simulate how a typical survival machine makes decisions about whether to behave altruistic behavior, we should probably do this: make a list of all the behaviors that the animal may do, and then program a weighted calculus for each mode of these behaviors. All kinds of interests are given a positive sign and all kinds of risks are given a negative sign. Then it is weighted, that is, each benefit and risk are multiplied by an appropriate index indicating kinship. Then add up the figures. For the convenience of calculation, we don’t consider the weights of other aspects such as age and health status at the beginning. Since an individual’s kinship index to himself is 1 (that is, he has 100% of his own genes - it is self-evident), there is no need to discount all his risks and interests, that is, give full weight in the calculation. In this way, the sum of each possible behavior pattern is roughly as follows: the net benefit of the behavior pattern = benefit to oneself - risk to oneself + 1 / 2 benefit to Brothers - 1 / 2 risk to brothers + 1 / 2 benefit to another brother - 1 / 2 risk to another brother + 1 / 8 benefit to cousins - 1 / 8 risk to cousins + 1 / 2 benefit to children - 1 / 2 risk to children +<br>We can therefore conclude that in terms of the evolution of altruistic behavior, the importance of “real” kinship may not be as important as animals can estimate kinship. To understand this fact, we can understand why parental love is much more common and sincere than altruistic behavior between brothers / sisters in nature, and why its own interests are even more important to animals than several brothers. In short, I mean, in addition to the kinship index, we should also consider the “certainty” index. Although the parent / child relationship is not closer than the brother / sister relationship in the sense of genetics, it is much more positive. In general, it is not as easy to be sure who is your brother as to be sure who is your child. As for who you are, it’s easier to be sure.<br>There is another asymmetry in parent-child relationships, which does not apply to brother / sister relationships. Children are always younger than their parents, which often, if not forever, means that children have a longer life expectancy. As I emphasized above, life expectancy is an important variable. In the most ideal environment, an animal should consider this variable in “calculus” to “decide” whether it needs to show altruistic behavior. In species where children’s average life expectancy is longer than that of their parents, any gene that manipulates children’s altruistic behavior will be at a disadvantage, because the beneficiaries of altruistic self sacrifice manipulated by these genes are older and nearer the age of the altruists themselves. On the other hand, in terms of life expectancy in the equation, the genes that manipulate parental altruistic behavior are in a relatively favorable position.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 3 the immortal double helix<br>A DNA molecule is a long chain of building blocks called nucleotides. Just as protein molecules are amino acid chains, DNA molecules are nucleotide chains. DNA is too small to be seen by the naked eye, but its exact shape has been cleverly revealed by human indirectly. It is composed of a pair of nucleotide chains. The two chains interweave each other in an elegant spiral shape, which is called “double helix” or “immortal helix”. There are only four kinds of nucleotide components, which can be referred to as a, t, C and G for short. In all animals and plants, the four are the same, but the difference is the order in which they intertwine.<br>Another aspect of gene graininess is that it does not age, and even a gene that has lived for one million years is not more likely to die than a partner that has only lived for 100 years. It transfers from one individual to another generation by generation, and controls one individual after another in its own way to achieve its own goal; It abandons dying individuals before they fall into aging and death.<br>Chapter 4 gene machine<br>Like Andromeda, genes can only do their best to deploy everything in advance, build a fast-moving computer for themselves, make them master the laws of as many situations as genes can “expect”, and give “advice” for this. But life is as unpredictable as chess. It is unrealistic to foresee everything in advance. Like the programmers of chess games, the “instructions” of genes to the survival machine can not be specific and subtle, it can only be the general strategy and various tips for livelihood.<br>In a complex world, there are certain risks in making predictions about the future., Every decision of the survival machine is a gambling behavior. Genes have the responsibility to program the brain in advance so that the decisions made by the brain can achieve positive results. In the evolutionary casino, the chip is survival, strictly speaking, the survival of genes. But in order to be reasonable, the general similar statement can also be individual survival.<br>Every time a contact system comes into being, there is always a risk that some creatures will use the system for their own benefit. Because we have been influenced by the evolutionary view of “species interests”, we naturally think that liars and cheaters belong to different species: predators, prey animals, parasites and so on. However, when there is a conflict of interests between different individuals’ genes, it is inevitable that there will be such behaviors as lying, cheating and selfish communication. This includes different individuals belonging to the same species. We will see that even children cheat their parents, husbands cheat their wives, and brothers cheat each other.<br>Some people believe that animal contact signals were originally developed for mutual benefit, but later used by bad elements. After all, this idea is too naive. The actual situation is likely to be: from the beginning, all animal contact behaviors are mixed with some kind of fraud, because all animals have to involve at least some kind of conflict of interest when they interact with each other.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text<br>Chapter 1 Why would anyone?<br>It is of course beneficial for me to use the method of reduction to absurdity to demonstrate and reveal the dilemma that the theory of group selection can not justify itself, but the obvious altruistic behavior of individuals still needs to be explained.<br>My belief is deeply influenced by Williams’ great book adaptation and natural selection. The central point I want to use can be traced back to the late 19th century and the early 20th century, when Weisman’s “continuity of the germplasms” theory predicted today’s development. The basic unit of choice that I will demonstrate, that is, the basic unit of self-interest, is neither species nor group, nor even individual, strictly speaking, but genetic unit gene.<br>Chapter 2 Replicator<br>The hemoglobin in our blood is a typical protein molecule. It consists of smaller molecules, chains of amino acids, each containing dozens of atoms arranged precisely. There are 574 amino acid molecules in the hemoglobin molecule, which are arranged into four intertwined chains to form a solid sphere. The complexity of its structure is really dazzling. A model of hemoglobin molecule looks like a dense Tribulus terrestris, but it is different from a real Tribulus terrestris. It is not a random approximate model, but a fixed structure. This structure is repeated more than 60 trillion times in the human body, and its structure is exactly the same. Hemoglobin, a protein molecule like Tribulus terrestris, is stable in shape. That is to say, its two pairs of chains composed of amino acids with the same sequence tend to form exactly the same three-dimensional coiled structure like two springs. In the human body, hemoglobin tribulus forms their “favorite” shape at the rate of about 400 trillion per second, while other hemoglobin is destroyed at the same rate.<br>Today, they live together in groups, live in the giant “robot” body, separate from the outside world, connect with the outside world through indirect circuitous ways, and control the outside world through remote control. They exist in you and me, they create us, they create our bodies and minds, and preserving them is the ultimate reason for our existence. These replicators have a long history. Today, we call them genes, and we are their survival machines.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p><em>Catalogue</em><br>Chapter 1 Why are there people?<br>Curious children often ask, “Why are there people?” Darwin enabled us to give a practical answer to this question. Is life meaningful? What is the purpose of life? What is human? In the face of these profound problems, we no longer need to turn to the supernatural.<br>Chapter 2 replication factors<br>They exist in you and me, they create us, they create our bodies and minds, and preserving them is the ultimate reason for our existence. These replicators have a long history. Today, we call them genes, and we are their survival machines.<br>Chapter 3 the immortal double helix<br>DNA is too small to be seen by the naked eye, but its exact shape has been cleverly revealed by human indirectly. It is composed of a pair of nucleotide chains. The two chains interweave with each other in an elegant spiral shape, which is called “double helix” or “immortal helix”.<br>Chapter 4 gene machine<br>Polar bear genes can be sure to know in advance that their unborn survival machine will face a cold environment. This prediction is not the result of genetic thinking. They don’t think: they’re just prepping a thick coat of fur, because in some previous bodies, they always did.<br>Chapter 5 aggressive behavior: the machine of stability and selfishness<br>For the survival machine, the logical strategy seems to be to kill its competitors and then better eat them. Although massacre and cannibalism occur in nature, it is a naive understanding of selfish gene theory that this phenomenon is widespread.<br>Chapter 6 gene race<br>According to Hamilton’s theory of heredity, we can easily explain the feud between clans and the fight between families. Incest taboo shows that human beings have a deep sense of kinship, although the genetic benefits of incest taboo have nothing to do with altruism. It is probably related to the harmful effects of recessive genes produced by inbreeding.<br>Chapter 7 family planning<br>The reason why individuals regulate the number of eggs in their nests is not the motivation of altruism. They will not implement birth control in order to avoid excessive consumption of group resources. Their goal of birth control is to maximize the survival of their existing children, which runs counter to our original goal of birth control.<br>Chapter 8 the battle of generations<br>It’s a delicate fight, with both sides going all out and not bound by any rules. Children use every opportunity to cheat. It will pretend to be more hungry than it is, maybe younger than it is, or face greater danger than it is. On the other hand, parents should be alert to such deception and try their best to avoid being cheated.<br>Chapter 9 gender war<br>In view of the fact that sperm is easy to lose, male fish must wait until the female spawns before ejaculating on the egg. But in this way, the female fish has a rare few seconds to slip away and leave the fertilized eggs in the care of the male fish, putting them in what trevors calls a dilemma.<br>Chapter 10 you itch for me, I’ll ride on your head<br>Suppose B has a parasite on its head, and a removes it. Soon after, a had parasites on his head. Of course, a went to B, hoping that B would get rid of them in return. As a result, B sniffed and turned around. B is a swindler. This swindler accepts the favor of others, but he is not grateful.<br>Chapter 11 finding the mother: a new replicator<br>I think a new type of replicator has recently emerged on our planet. It’s right in front of us, but it’s still in its infancy, still clumsily drifting in its original soup. But it’s pushing the evolutionary process so fast that the original factor is out of reach. This new soup is the soup of human culture.<br>Chapter 12 a good man is rewarded<br>The number of good people is doomed to decrease, and goodness will eventually perish in Darwinism. There is another special explanation for “good man” here, which is not far from the meaning in the common saying. But in this kind of explanation, good people can “get what they want.”.<br>Chapter 13 gene extension<br>We can further infer that genes in one organism can have extended phenotypic effects on another. Genes escape from their own bodies and manipulate the outside world.<br>Chapter 14 gene determinism and gene selection<br>For centuries, philosophers and theologians have been debating whether determinism is correct and whether it is related to a person’s moral responsibility for his own actions.<br>Chapter 15 restriction on Perfection<br>The animals we see today may be “out of date”, and the genes that affect the establishment process were selected at an earlier time to cope with different conditions.</p>

            <p>  Last week, our Jinling A-level center organized a visit to Lishui special agricultural education base. We stayed there for three days and learned many useful agricultural knowledge. Although it rained sometimes and was so hot, we kept on doing activities. Since we did a large number of activities, I prefer to choose some which impressed me most during that time.</p>
<p>  The first one was planting chrysanthemum. It was not as simple as we had thought. We needed to use the hoe to  scarify the soil and let the rain flow away without flooding. Then, we used the Shovel to dig a hole with proper size to put the seedling. Finally, we watered them with the watering pot.</p>
<p>  The second one was grounding soybean milk. We were divided into several groups to do this. Every group had a stone mill, a bowl of soybean, a basin of water and a brush. The process was more difficult and tedious. Firstly, pour in some soybean and add water. Next, turn the mill counter anticlockwise at a high speed. Then, pour the slurry into the stone mill and grind it again until it becomes thinner. After that, pour all the slurry into a big gauze funnel in order to get purer soy milk. Finally, heat the soy milk and add some white granulated sugar. We all tasted the finished product, which was unexpectedly delicious.</p>
<p>  The last one was cuttaging green vines. This project tested our patience and carefulness. We wet nutrient soil in the beginning and put two thirds of the volume of the flowerpot in the flowerpot. Then, the most important step came. Cut the cane vines of the green vines and cut their stems obliquely in order to absorb more nutrition. What’s more, we needed to keep three branches and make them upwards when inserting the soil. Finally, add some dry soil and water it throughout. It did take us a long time to do these.</p>
<p>  Furthermore, we got the chance to watch fireworks luckily as it is banned in the city. We really learned a lot from this visit and had a good time with our classmates, teachers and instructors.</p>

            <p>​                                                                          A personal goal</p>
<p>​    At Jinling High School, my personal goal was to work hard enough to be able to apply to study Biomedicine at university. This was because I would like to be a doctor or some other jobs related to this field in the future. My college counsellor had emphasized how important it was to choose the right course to allow a future, successful career. </p>
<p>​    When I set this goal, my mother and college counselor both did something helpful. First of all when my mother knew my goal, she started to find suitable extra-curricular activities immediately since there is no biology course in our school. She helped me get to the class with some other students in my school. It is true that learning Biology is not easy, especially in English, since it requires you to master a large number of rare words and many basic principles that are difficult to understand, but I am working hard on it as I do need the academic knowledge first in order to pass the A-level biology examination. In addition, it can help me take part in competitions like IBO and BBO which are useful when I apply for university since they will let the University feel that I am more able to learn the course well. Additionally, my college counselor recommended some books on biology to me, such as ‘The Selfish Gene’ and ‘Talk to the Disease - general practitioner’s notes’. After reading them, I seemed to have opened the door to a new world. Apart from gaining useful knowledge from the books, I also really enjoyed myself learning through reading which was also relaxing. </p>
<p>​    Furthermore, reading these books can expand my knowledge in this field and let me have a deeper understanding about it. In fact, since I set this goal, my learning schedule has become busy, but it has also enriched my everyday life. Through this, I learned that to achieve my goal, I must make unremitting efforts and every step is very important. </p>
<p>​    So far, I am still working hard for my long-term goal, although it is difficult to apply for this major since few students have succeeded in entering this field before, I will never give up, because it is my dream.</p>
