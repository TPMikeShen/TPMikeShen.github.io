            <p>  Today is the third day of the new year 2021, happy new year to everyone. Last week, our Jinling High School were busy preparing for the celebration of the New Year’s Day. The annual Food Festival which is special in our school was held successfully on December 31, 2020 through the joint efforts of all the teachers and students.</p>
<p>  In the afternoon, the expecting Food Festival started. This was the first time I took part in this event and I worked as a salesman with some of my classmates in stead of consuming food around other classes’ stands. Before that, we had worried about that we wouldn’t sell many products since we didn’t have experience, so that we wouldn’t know what kinds of food would students and teachers like to buy. Although we had thought about many kinds of food and taken advice from our class adviser, we finally decided to mainly make bubble tea for sell.</p>
<p>  At first, we thought that there wouldn’t be many people coming to purchase the bubble tea. We even asked one of our classmates to peddle with a loudspeaker. A few minutes later, we realized that we were wrong. A large number of students, teachers and parents were attracted by the loud sound and came to see what we sold. As it was very cold outside, they all wanted to drink something hot to warm themselves. There was an endless stream of customers, so I with my partner became busy making bubble tea. The raw material of bubble tea were Jinjunmei tea and fresh milk which were well-prepared and mixed together in our classroom by the other two group members. We just needed to add some ingredients to the Original bubble tea according the flavor that the customers chose. We had five different flavors in total and all of them were consumed by the customers. I was not very familiar with the process and which ingredients to add in in the beginning, but as the time went by, I did it more and more quickly through the methods that my partner taught me. A customer once ordered four cups of bubble tea and that made me improve my speed. Some volunteers of parents in our class were also willing to help us with our sales work. They prepared other kinds of food like oden and pudding to attract more customers and that helped us a lot.</p>
<p>  Unexpectedly, we sold out all of our products and were short in supply. Although the weather was cold and we were all frozen stiff, our hearts were full of warmness as well as fulfillment. </p>
<p>  That was really an meaningful and unforgettable experience.</p>

            <p>  Today is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas to everyone. </p>
<p>  Yesterday, our Jinling High School International Center held an event called “Gift exchange activity”. Just as the name suggests, it is an activity that students exchange gifts. The gifts should be between 20 yuan and 100 yuan. Before the day, students who wanted to take part in the activity had prepared  nice gifts and wrapped them up. Then, the members of student union collected all of them and put them in the teachers’ office. On the day, the members of student union got busy giving presents to students randomly. If you prepared  a gift, you would receive a gift from anyone else. The main attraction of this activity was that you would never know what you would get until you received the gift. The gift which I prepared was a box of biscuits. However, What I received was a vacuum cup. I was surprised that it was new and just could be used practically. Some other students in my class got other different kinds of gifts, such as perfume, stationery, snacks and teacup. Although some might not be satisfied with what they got, they knew that gifts only represented the wishes and enjoyed themselves in the activity.</p>
<p>  I believe that through this activity, all the students will get on well with each other and learn in a better state.  </p>

            <p>  On last Tuesday afternoon, our Jinling High School international department held the International Spelling Bee Final. Both students in Chinese-American classes and Chinese-Cambridge classes took part in the competition. We were all very excited to watch the intense game.</p>
<p>  There were four groups which contained total 16 students in both classes. They were grouped by class and gender. The competition had three parts which were “Required questions”, “Rush to answer questions” and “Reward questions”. Competition scoring, divided into individuals, groups and classes. The teacher awarded prizes according to these scores.</p>
<p>  As soon as the starting of the competition,  competitors began to spell the word one by one. Although they were so nervous, they still tried to spell complex words calmly. At the beginning of the individual competition, the Chinese-American classes were in the ascendant. However, students in Chinese-Cambridge classes then found their own pace and got most of questions correctly in the second part. As a result, the gap was widening between two classes. In the competition that followed, students in Chinese-Cambridge classes won the game with excellent performance, especially “Bee King”.</p>
<p>  This competition not only made us learn some useful and academic words, but also let us know English is a language for communication instead of only for exam, such as IELTS and TOEFL. I hope that students will performance better and enjoy more in the next competition.</p>

            <p>  In the first week of December, our school held a science festival. It takes place once every two years. It was the ninth science festival in Jinling High School. This year, our school invited some teachers in Nanjing University to join in our activities. It was such a fantastic activity that I enjoyed it very much. The main activities had two parts which were science experience project and science competition project. Before the start of activities, we had several shows to welcome the opening ceremony. They all had special and attractive names which were “robot dance”, “fire on the hand”, “air cannon”, “cloud engineer” and “liquid nitrogen mushroom cloud”. However, behind these names, their principles were very difficult and called for deep thought.</p>
<p>  I took part in a project called “fire on the hand”. It can make the fire burn on your hand for a short while. I thought it was amazing and had a try. When the teacher ignited the bubble fluid on my hand, I felt just my hand was warm. How it works? First, you need to prepare bubble fluid , a lighter and a bottle of butane which is the main thing can be burned. Next, you can add the butane into the bubble fluid. Then, you should soak your hands in bubble liquid. Finally, put some more bubble fluid on your hand and ignite it . A big fire will appear on your hand without hurt yourself. Although it has a risk of being burned, it is worth experiencing. There were also many other wonderful activities on the festival. All the teachers and students enjoyed a lot. </p>
<p>  In conclusion, science is not only interesting, but also meaningful to our everyday life.</p>

            <p>This Friday, I took part in a volunteer work in Jiangsu Grand Theater. There were also many other people volunteering there from all ages. We all shared the same interest in music, so we worked together. It was a concert of chamber piano and string quartet. Before we enjoyed the concert, we were divided into several groups to guide the way for the visitors in all entrances.</p>
<p>During the outbreak, we were all asked to put on masks to avoid accidents. There weren’t so many people in the place where my group stayed in because it wasn’t the major entrance. However, we were all very enthusiastic to the people who had problem finding the way, although most people didn’t ask the way to the concert of chamber piano and string quartet. I was asked about the way to a restaurant which I didn’t know from a woman. I didn’t know how to reply to her at that moment. One of my team members helped me answer her and finally found the way. I felt very thankful to him. We stayed in the cold wind for about half an hour. Although we felt cold physically, we felt warm in heart because we helped others on our own.  </p>
