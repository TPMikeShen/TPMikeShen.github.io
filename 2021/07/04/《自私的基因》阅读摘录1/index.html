        <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p><em>Catalogue</em><br>Chapter 1 Why are there people?<br>Curious children often ask, “Why are there people?” Darwin enabled us to give a practical answer to this question. Is life meaningful? What is the purpose of life? What is human? In the face of these profound problems, we no longer need to turn to the supernatural.<br>Chapter 2 replication factors<br>They exist in you and me, they create us, they create our bodies and minds, and preserving them is the ultimate reason for our existence. These replicators have a long history. Today, we call them genes, and we are their survival machines.<br>Chapter 3 the immortal double helix<br>DNA is too small to be seen by the naked eye, but its exact shape has been cleverly revealed by human indirectly. It is composed of a pair of nucleotide chains. The two chains interweave with each other in an elegant spiral shape, which is called “double helix” or “immortal helix”.<br>Chapter 4 gene machine<br>Polar bear genes can be sure to know in advance that their unborn survival machine will face a cold environment. This prediction is not the result of genetic thinking. They don’t think: they’re just prepping a thick coat of fur, because in some previous bodies, they always did.<br>Chapter 5 aggressive behavior: the machine of stability and selfishness<br>For the survival machine, the logical strategy seems to be to kill its competitors and then better eat them. Although massacre and cannibalism occur in nature, it is a naive understanding of selfish gene theory that this phenomenon is widespread.<br>Chapter 6 gene race<br>According to Hamilton’s theory of heredity, we can easily explain the feud between clans and the fight between families. Incest taboo shows that human beings have a deep sense of kinship, although the genetic benefits of incest taboo have nothing to do with altruism. It is probably related to the harmful effects of recessive genes produced by inbreeding.<br>Chapter 7 family planning<br>The reason why individuals regulate the number of eggs in their nests is not the motivation of altruism. They will not implement birth control in order to avoid excessive consumption of group resources. Their goal of birth control is to maximize the survival of their existing children, which runs counter to our original goal of birth control.<br>Chapter 8 the battle of generations<br>It’s a delicate fight, with both sides going all out and not bound by any rules. Children use every opportunity to cheat. It will pretend to be more hungry than it is, maybe younger than it is, or face greater danger than it is. On the other hand, parents should be alert to such deception and try their best to avoid being cheated.<br>Chapter 9 gender war<br>In view of the fact that sperm is easy to lose, male fish must wait until the female spawns before ejaculating on the egg. But in this way, the female fish has a rare few seconds to slip away and leave the fertilized eggs in the care of the male fish, putting them in what trevors calls a dilemma.<br>Chapter 10 you itch for me, I’ll ride on your head<br>Suppose B has a parasite on its head, and a removes it. Soon after, a had parasites on his head. Of course, a went to B, hoping that B would get rid of them in return. As a result, B sniffed and turned around. B is a swindler. This swindler accepts the favor of others, but he is not grateful.<br>Chapter 11 finding the mother: a new replicator<br>I think a new type of replicator has recently emerged on our planet. It’s right in front of us, but it’s still in its infancy, still clumsily drifting in its original soup. But it’s pushing the evolutionary process so fast that the original factor is out of reach. This new soup is the soup of human culture.<br>Chapter 12 a good man is rewarded<br>The number of good people is doomed to decrease, and goodness will eventually perish in Darwinism. There is another special explanation for “good man” here, which is not far from the meaning in the common saying. But in this kind of explanation, good people can “get what they want.”.<br>Chapter 13 gene extension<br>We can further infer that genes in one organism can have extended phenotypic effects on another. Genes escape from their own bodies and manipulate the outside world.<br>Chapter 14 gene determinism and gene selection<br>For centuries, philosophers and theologians have been debating whether determinism is correct and whether it is related to a person’s moral responsibility for his own actions.<br>Chapter 15 restriction on Perfection<br>The animals we see today may be “out of date”, and the genes that affect the establishment process were selected at an earlier time to cope with different conditions.</p>
