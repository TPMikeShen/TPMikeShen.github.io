        <p>  Today is the third day of the new year 2021, happy new year to everyone. Last week, our Jinling High School were busy preparing for the celebration of the New Year’s Day. The annual Food Festival which is special in our school was held successfully on December 31, 2020 through the joint efforts of all the teachers and students.</p>
<p>  In the afternoon, the expecting Food Festival started. This was the first time I took part in this event and I worked as a salesman with some of my classmates in stead of consuming food around other classes’ stands. Before that, we had worried about that we wouldn’t sell many products since we didn’t have experience, so that we wouldn’t know what kinds of food would students and teachers like to buy. Although we had thought about many kinds of food and taken advice from our class adviser, we finally decided to mainly make bubble tea for sell.</p>
<p>  At first, we thought that there wouldn’t be many people coming to purchase the bubble tea. We even asked one of our classmates to peddle with a loudspeaker. A few minutes later, we realized that we were wrong. A large number of students, teachers and parents were attracted by the loud sound and came to see what we sold. As it was very cold outside, they all wanted to drink something hot to warm themselves. There was an endless stream of customers, so I with my partner became busy making bubble tea. The raw material of bubble tea were Jinjunmei tea and fresh milk which were well-prepared and mixed together in our classroom by the other two group members. We just needed to add some ingredients to the Original bubble tea according the flavor that the customers chose. We had five different flavors in total and all of them were consumed by the customers. I was not very familiar with the process and which ingredients to add in in the beginning, but as the time went by, I did it more and more quickly through the methods that my partner taught me. A customer once ordered four cups of bubble tea and that made me improve my speed. Some volunteers of parents in our class were also willing to help us with our sales work. They prepared other kinds of food like oden and pudding to attract more customers and that helped us a lot.</p>
<p>  Unexpectedly, we sold out all of our products and were short in supply. Although the weather was cold and we were all frozen stiff, our hearts were full of warmness as well as fulfillment. </p>
<p>  That was really an meaningful and unforgettable experience.</p>
