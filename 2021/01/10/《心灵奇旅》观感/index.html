        <p>  Last Friday, I went to watch a film called <em>Soul</em> with some of my classmates. That was such a fantastic film that it impressed all of us.</p>
<p>  The film is made by Disney Company. The style of the film is simple and real as always. It tells us a story which happens in the New York. The main character Joey Gunner is a middle school music teacher who lives a very boring life. His dream is to be a jazz musician who can live by playing music. However, when the day comes, he falls into a sewer by accident and dies. He goes to the Soul World which is a completely different world from the earth. There are dying souls, souls which about to be born and blackened souls. He is introduced to be a tutor by a kind cosmic creator because he doesn’t want to die as his good life has just begun. There, he meats a soul who doesn’t want to be born on the earth called 22. A large number of famous people have been his tutors to help him find his value in life, but all of them fail. 22 finds it boring to live on the earth, so he refuses to be born. Nevertheless, Joey Gunner helps 22 find his goal of life by let his soul experience his life in the body which belongs to Joey Gunner. Unfortunately, he doesn’t want to leave Joey Gunner body and is caught by another cosmic creator who works as a manager of the dead souls. As Joey Gunner comes back to his own life, he doesn’t feel it changing too much as before. He feels that something is missing. When he turns to the Soul World again, 22 has become a blackened soul. He tries his best to save him. Finally, he touches 22 and gives the chance of himself to him so that 22 can go to the earth to be born. He is also given another chance to be alive again since he inspires the cosmic creators some new things.</p>
<p>  It is really a moving movie. The ups and downs of the plot attract all of us. As usual, the movie has a wonderful happy ending. The most important thing I learned from the movie is “No one is born with the purpose of life as if you don’t experience in reality by yourself, you won’t know what it is like. You will know what you enjoy doing ,even just walking, in your everyday life as time goes by.” There are also some other good points that the movie tells us. For example, the main character Joey Gunner teaches us you will achieve your dream if you never give up. Also, you should be kind instead of selfish in your life. The blackened souls represent the people who are overwhelmed by life and fall into obsession. We should enjoy the present life since we are all very lucky to be born in this world.</p>
<p>  I highly recommend this film. If you want to know more details about the film, please go to watch it.</p>
