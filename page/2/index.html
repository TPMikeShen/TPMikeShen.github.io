            <p>  Last week, our Jinling A-level center organized a visit to Lishui special agricultural education base. We stayed there for three days and learned many useful agricultural knowledge. Although it rained sometimes and was so hot, we kept on doing activities. Since we did a large number of activities, I prefer to choose some which impressed me most during that time.</p>
<p>  The first one was planting chrysanthemum. It was not as simple as we had thought. We needed to use the hoe to  scarify the soil and let the rain flow away without flooding. Then, we used the Shovel to dig a hole with proper size to put the seedling. Finally, we watered them with the watering pot.</p>
<p>  The second one was grounding soybean milk. We were divided into several groups to do this. Every group had a stone mill, a bowl of soybean, a basin of water and a brush. The process was more difficult and tedious. Firstly, pour in some soybean and add water. Next, turn the mill counter anticlockwise at a high speed. Then, pour the slurry into the stone mill and grind it again until it becomes thinner. After that, pour all the slurry into a big gauze funnel in order to get purer soy milk. Finally, heat the soy milk and add some white granulated sugar. We all tasted the finished product, which was unexpectedly delicious.</p>
<p>  The last one was cuttaging green vines. This project tested our patience and carefulness. We wet nutrient soil in the beginning and put two thirds of the volume of the flowerpot in the flowerpot. Then, the most important step came. Cut the cane vines of the green vines and cut their stems obliquely in order to absorb more nutrition. What’s more, we needed to keep three branches and make them upwards when inserting the soil. Finally, add some dry soil and water it throughout. It did take us a long time to do these.</p>
<p>  Furthermore, we got the chance to watch fireworks luckily as it is banned in the city. We really learned a lot from this visit and had a good time with our classmates, teachers and instructors.</p>

            <p>​                                                                          A personal goal</p>
<p>​    At Jinling High School, my personal goal was to work hard enough to be able to apply to study Biomedicine at university. This was because I would like to be a doctor or some other jobs related to this field in the future. My college counsellor had emphasized how important it was to choose the right course to allow a future, successful career. </p>
<p>​    When I set this goal, my mother and college counselor both did something helpful. First of all when my mother knew my goal, she started to find suitable extra-curricular activities immediately since there is no biology course in our school. She helped me get to the class with some other students in my school. It is true that learning Biology is not easy, especially in English, since it requires you to master a large number of rare words and many basic principles that are difficult to understand, but I am working hard on it as I do need the academic knowledge first in order to pass the A-level biology examination. In addition, it can help me take part in competitions like IBO and BBO which are useful when I apply for university since they will let the University feel that I am more able to learn the course well. Additionally, my college counselor recommended some books on biology to me, such as ‘The Selfish Gene’ and ‘Talk to the Disease - general practitioner’s notes’. After reading them, I seemed to have opened the door to a new world. Apart from gaining useful knowledge from the books, I also really enjoyed myself learning through reading which was also relaxing. </p>
<p>​    Furthermore, reading these books can expand my knowledge in this field and let me have a deeper understanding about it. In fact, since I set this goal, my learning schedule has become busy, but it has also enriched my everyday life. Through this, I learned that to achieve my goal, I must make unremitting efforts and every step is very important. </p>
<p>​    So far, I am still working hard for my long-term goal, although it is difficult to apply for this major since few students have succeeded in entering this field before, I will never give up, because it is my dream.</p>

            <p>  Yesterday, I took part in a volunteer work called <em>Big hand holding small hand, love helping growth</em>, which took place in Jiangxinzhou Zhoutai community. The purpose of the activity was to help the families which had difficulty in education and living solve their problems and donate some stationeries and books to them.</p>
<p>  The leader was a network reporter who had organized many similar activities before. We went into the first part which allowed volunteer parents to share their experience about education at home with those parents who were in need from the community. Several mothers talked in the beginning since in most families, they played important roles in education and tutoring children. Later, a few fathers talked about how they helped with the home education as the leader asked them to do so.</p>
<p>  We, Jinling High School students, also said something about how to study in primary school and gave some advice. Maybe the children couldn’t understand what we meant, bur the parents really benefited a lot.</p>
<p>  Finally, we gave them our gifts as well as blessing cards. What I wrote on the card was that “Life is difficult, but as long as you work hard, you will see the rainbow after the rain; as long as you are tenacious, you can always overcome difficulties and obstacles, pass the exam; as long as you persist, you will realize your dream and succeed in your studies. Learn to face, learn to accept, learn to change, learn to grow. You will certainly be able to change your destiny, be masters of your own destiny and realize your life value. May you live each day in peace and happiness!”</p>
<p>  This was really a meaningful volunteer work.</p>

            <p>  My name is Shen Ziyou and my English name is Mike. I am a 16-year-old student in Jinglin High School and hoping to go to university to study biochemistry in when I pass my exams in 2022. I have a big family, but I live with my parents in Nanjing. Furthermore, I have many hobbies, such as playing the piano, playing badminton and listening to music. Moreover, in my free time, I like reading books too, in particular, science fiction. Sometimes, I also read some classic works and literature novels such as <em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>
<p>   In my mother’s eyes, I am not an extrovert or an active boy before other people, but I always focus on what I am doing and I am not talkative. I can do things well because of my patience and carefulness. I am very persistent and determined. For instance, I have been practicing playing the piano and devoting most of my time to it for almost twelve years. As a result, I have a useful skill which someone else may not have and I believe that it will help my life in some way one day. On the other hand, in my friends’ opinions, maybe I am shy and seldom talk to others, but I get on well with people I know well and can trust. </p>
<p>   I am very proud of an activity I took part in at Primary School when I was a child. In the beginning, my classmates and I were put into groups and asked to pick up rubbish on the streets. Around our school, there were so much garbage, such as plastic bottles, cigarette butts and packing paper. I had thought that it would not take us much time to clean several streets, however, unexpectedly, we were doing this the whole morning until 12 o’clock that day. Because of this, we were all tired out and wanted to lie on the ground at once when we finished! Through this activity, I not only learnt that this is not easy work, but also realized the importance of protecting the environment. Most importantly, it was the first time that I did something to help society with my own hands. </p>
<p>   In conclusion, this was an unforgettable experience because it was meaningful and Inspiring. This taught me excellent skills for my future such as teamworking and improving my communication skills.</p>

            <p>  Last Wednesday, our Jinling International Center held an activity called <em>Talk to the workplace and meet the future</em>. Our school invited many successful parents to introduce different kinds of fields for us. This would help us find what we are interested in and what we need to work hard on.</p>
<p>  I attended the lecture about material science. Teacher Ma first made a general introduction about the topic. From the lecture, I have known that the material can be generally divided in two ways which are nature and function. According to the first way, materials can be divided into three kinds that are polymer materials, metal materials and inorganic nonmetallic materials. According to the second way, materials can also be divided into three kinds that are structural materials, functional materials and biological materials. Use the inorganic nonmetallic materials as an example, it has common materials like concrete and ceramics. Nowadays, the material science is everywhere in our daily life. Actually, we can use a special  kind of material to make our mobile phones which can make them lighter. Go further, we can reduce the expansion coefficient of rail to reduce the noise made by high-speed rail. Hydrogen storage material is a popular project now as if we make it, we can use more pollution free hydrogen energy. In order to achieve this, we first need the technology called solid fusion which can mix solids just like liquids. This can improve the strength of the material. Another is called new ceramics. By firing the SiC particles, carbon fiber can be toughened. Beyond the visible materials, the scientists are applying to research materials in microcosmic by electron microscopes. Overall, the material science is all about the component, structure, performance and machining of materials.</p>
<p>  After the main topic, Teacher Ma also introduced something about Neurology and Psychiatry. Most of us believe that depression is a mental illness. However, he said that it is caused by autonomic nervous disorder in the nervous system. Because of this, neurotransmitters will not be secreted properly. Then, it will lead to depression finally. To our surprise, he said that it can be easily cured by pricking your fingers. He explained that this can get the nervous system back to normal. We couldn’t believe that at first, but he told us that some people had done that and had been cured of such illness. I think that some of what he said are true, but the other things have to be done further research.</p>
<p>  I benefited a lot from the lecture in deed. I hope our school will held more activities like this.</p>

            <p>  Last Friday, I went to watch a film called <em>Soul</em> with some of my classmates. That was such a fantastic film that it impressed all of us.</p>
<p>  The film is made by Disney Company. The style of the film is simple and real as always. It tells us a story which happens in the New York. The main character Joey Gunner is a middle school music teacher who lives a very boring life. His dream is to be a jazz musician who can live by playing music. However, when the day comes, he falls into a sewer by accident and dies. He goes to the Soul World which is a completely different world from the earth. There are dying souls, souls which about to be born and blackened souls. He is introduced to be a tutor by a kind cosmic creator because he doesn’t want to die as his good life has just begun. There, he meets a soul who doesn’t want to be born on the earth called 22. A large number of famous people have been his tutors to help him find his value in life, but all of them fail. 22 finds it boring to live on the earth, so he refuses to be born. Nevertheless, Joey Gunner helps 22 find his goal of life by let his soul experience his life in the body which belongs to Joey Gunner. Unfortunately, he doesn’t want to leave Joey Gunner body and is caught by another cosmic creator who works as a manager of the dead souls. As Joey Gunner comes back to his own life, he doesn’t feel it changing too much as before. He feels that something is missing. When he turns to the Soul World again, 22 has become a blackened soul. He tries his best to save him. Finally, he touches 22 and gives the chance of himself to him so that 22 can go to the earth to be born. He is also given another chance to be alive again since he inspires the cosmic creators some new things.</p>
<p>  It is really a moving movie. The ups and downs of the plot attract all of us. As usual, the movie has a wonderful happy ending. The most important thing I learned from the movie is “No one is born with the purpose of life as if you don’t experience in reality by yourself, you won’t know what it is like. You will know what you enjoy doing ,even just walking, in your everyday life as time goes by.” There are also some other good points that the movie tells us. For example, the main character Joey Gunner teaches us you will achieve your dream if you never give up. Also, you should be kind instead of selfish in your life. The blackened souls represent the people who are overwhelmed by life and fall into obsession. We should enjoy the present life since we are all very lucky to be born in this world.</p>
<p>  I highly recommend this film. If you want to know more details about the film, please go to watch it.</p>

            <p>  Today is the third day of the new year 2021, happy new year to everyone. Last week, our Jinling High School were busy preparing for the celebration of the New Year’s Day. The annual Food Festival which is special in our school was held successfully on December 31, 2020 through the joint efforts of all the teachers and students.</p>
<p>  In the afternoon, the expecting Food Festival started. This was the first time I took part in this event and I worked as a salesman with some of my classmates in stead of consuming food around other classes’ stands. Before that, we had worried about that we wouldn’t sell many products since we didn’t have experience, so that we wouldn’t know what kinds of food would students and teachers like to buy. Although we had thought about many kinds of food and taken advice from our class adviser, we finally decided to mainly make bubble tea for sell.</p>
<p>  At first, we thought that there wouldn’t be many people coming to purchase the bubble tea. We even asked one of our classmates to peddle with a loudspeaker. A few minutes later, we realized that we were wrong. A large number of students, teachers and parents were attracted by the loud sound and came to see what we sold. As it was very cold outside, they all wanted to drink something hot to warm themselves. There was an endless stream of customers, so I with my partner became busy making bubble tea. The raw material of bubble tea were Jinjunmei tea and fresh milk which were well-prepared and mixed together in our classroom by the other two group members. We just needed to add some ingredients to the Original bubble tea according the flavor that the customers chose. We had five different flavors in total and all of them were consumed by the customers. I was not very familiar with the process and which ingredients to add in in the beginning, but as the time went by, I did it more and more quickly through the methods that my partner taught me. A customer once ordered four cups of bubble tea and that made me improve my speed. Some volunteers of parents in our class were also willing to help us with our sales work. They prepared other kinds of food like oden and pudding to attract more customers and that helped us a lot.</p>
<p>  Unexpectedly, we sold out all of our products and were short in supply. Although the weather was cold and we were all frozen stiff, our hearts were full of warmness as well as fulfillment. </p>
<p>  That was really an meaningful and unforgettable experience.</p>

            <p>  Today is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas to everyone. </p>
<p>  Yesterday, our Jinling High School International Center held an event called “Gift exchange activity”. Just as the name suggests, it is an activity that students exchange gifts. The gifts should be between 20 yuan and 100 yuan. Before the day, students who wanted to take part in the activity had prepared  nice gifts and wrapped them up. Then, the members of student union collected all of them and put them in the teachers’ office. On the day, the members of student union got busy giving presents to students randomly. If you prepared  a gift, you would receive a gift from anyone else. The main attraction of this activity was that you would never know what you would get until you received the gift. The gift which I prepared was a box of biscuits. However, What I received was a vacuum cup. I was surprised that it was new and just could be used practically. Some other students in my class got other different kinds of gifts, such as perfume, stationery, snacks and teacup. Although some might not be satisfied with what they got, they knew that gifts only represented the wishes and enjoyed themselves in the activity.</p>
<p>  I believe that through this activity, all the students will get on well with each other and learn in a better state.  </p>

            <p>  On last Tuesday afternoon, our Jinling High School international department held the International Spelling Bee Final. Both students in Chinese-American classes and Chinese-Cambridge classes took part in the competition. We were all very excited to watch the intense game.</p>
<p>  There were four groups which contained total 16 students in both classes. They were grouped by class and gender. The competition had three parts which were “Required questions”, “Rush to answer questions” and “Reward questions”. Competition scoring, divided into individuals, groups and classes. The teacher awarded prizes according to these scores.</p>
<p>  As soon as the starting of the competition,  competitors began to spell the word one by one. Although they were so nervous, they still tried to spell complex words calmly. At the beginning of the individual competition, the Chinese-American classes were in the ascendant. However, students in Chinese-Cambridge classes then found their own pace and got most of questions correctly in the second part. As a result, the gap was widening between two classes. In the competition that followed, students in Chinese-Cambridge classes won the game with excellent performance, especially “Bee King”.</p>
<p>  This competition not only made us learn some useful and academic words, but also let us know English is a language for communication instead of only for exam, such as IELTS and TOEFL. I hope that students will performance better and enjoy more in the next competition.</p>
