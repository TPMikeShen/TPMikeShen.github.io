            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 15 constraints on Perfection<br>I have been trying to show the advantages and disadvantages of adaptation theory, but the main purpose of this chapter is to make a list and classify various constraints on perfection, and to list the main reasons why students should move forward cautiously in the process of learning adaptability. Before discussing my six constraints on perfection, let’s talk about the other three constraints that others have put forward, but I find they are not very convincing. First, the debate on “neutral mutation” among contemporary biochemical geneticists has been cited in the criticism of adaptation theory, but in fact, the two are irrelevant. If there are neutral mutations called by biochemists, it means that any changes in protein structure caused by these mutations have no effect on protein enzyme activity. This means that these neutral mutations will not change the process of embryonic development, nor will they have any phenotypic effects at all - the phenotypic effects understood by biologists as a whole. The biochemical debate on neutrality is mainly concerned with an interesting and important question: whether all gene substitutions have phenotypic effects. The debate on adaptation theory is quite different. Its main concern is that since the phenotypic effect we study is large enough to be observed and raises questions about it, we should assume that it is the product of natural selection. Biochemists’ neutral mutation is not just neutral. As long as we biologists who study rudimentary morphology, physiology and behavior consider this problem, they are no longer mutations in our eyes. It is with this idea that Maynard Smith wrote: “I interpret the ‘rate of evolution’ as the rate of adaptive change. In this sense, the substitution of a neutral allele does not constitute evolution. “ If a biologist who studies biological individuals sees a phenotypic difference determined by genes, he already knows that he cannot be studying the “neutrality” debated by a contemporary biochemical geneticist.<br>The second one, which is proposed for the perfection restriction, considers the problem of allometric growth: “for deer of the subfamily Cervus, the growth rate of antler size is much faster than that of body size… So that larger deer have disproportionately large antlers. So there is no need to find a clear reason for the huge antlers on the big deer’s head. “ Of course, Levantin’s remark illustrates some problems, but I prefer to restate it. According to his words, the allometric growth rate should be a constant, as if it was an unalterable thing designated by God. However, constants on one time scale may also change on another time scale. Allometric growth constant is a parameter in embryonic development. Like any other such parameter, it may be dominated by genetic changes and may therefore change during evolution. In this way, levintin’s statement is similar to the following statement: all primates have teeth, which is just a fact about primates, so there is no need to give a clear adaptive reason for primates having teeth. However, what he really wants to express may be something similar to the following.<br>Leventin’s view on gene pleiotropy is related to another problem, which I should discuss here first. The problem is the definition of what he calls natural “suture” - the “phenotypic unit” of evolution. Sometimes the double effects of a gene are inseparable in theory. They are different sides of the same thing. Just as Mount Everest once had two names, it depends on which side you look at it. The oxygen carrying molecules in the eyes of a biochemist may be red in the eyes of behaviorists. But there is also a more interesting gene pleiotropy, in which the two phenotypic effects can be separated. The phenotypic effect of any gene (relative to its allele) is not the private property of the gene itself, but can be revealed with the help of the embryonic environment in which it plays a role. This provides a full opportunity for the phenotypic effect of one mutation to be changed by other effects, and also provides a basis for some excellent ideas, such as Fisher’s theory of dominant evolution, Medawar and Williams’ theory of aging, and Hamilton’s theory of Y chromosome embedding. In this connection, if a mutation has a favorable effect and a harmful effect, there is no reason why selection does not favor a modifier gene, which can separate the two phenotypic effects, or weaken the harmful effect and enhance the beneficial effect. As in the case of allometric growth, leventin’s view of gene behavior is too static, treating pleiotropy as the private property of the gene itself, rather than as the result of the interaction between the gene and its modifiable embryonic environment.<br><strong>Time lag</strong><br>The animals we see today are likely to be “outdated”, and the genes that affect their establishment process were selected at an earlier time to cope with different conditions from today.<br><strong>Historical constraints</strong><br>My own experience is that there may be a solution to the real paradox of historical constraints. The analogy of jet engine implies that animals should be funny giants made up at random under the spur, with strange relics left by patchy antiques in their unstable bodies.<br><strong>Available genetic changes</strong><br>No matter how strong a potential selection pressure is, it will not necessarily lead to evolution unless there is a genetic change that makes the selection pressure work.<br>Nature does not have the foresight to combine a series of mutations to put a strain on the path to the ultimate global optimum - even if they may lead to temporary shortcomings. Nature cannot restrain itself from favoring the available mutations that can bring small advantages at present, even if they can get greater benefits from the optimal mutations that will appear later. Like a river, natural selection blindly improves its downward path along an immediately selectable continuous route with minimal obstacles. It can be imagined that the animals obtained from this are not the most perfect design, or even just barely survive. It is the product of a series of historical changes, and each change at most represents the option that happened to be better at that time.<br><strong>Cost and material constraints</strong><br>I think the above hypothesis is more constructive and interesting than the hypothesis that “the necessary mutation never appeared”. Of course, we have to admit that the former hypothesis may also be true, but I prefer to just take it as the last straw.<br><strong>Imperfection caused by the selective action of another level at one level</strong><br>One of the main problems to be solved in this book is the level at which natural selection plays a role. The adaptability we should see when selection acts on the level of biological groups will be quite different from the adaptability we expect to see when selection acts on the level of biological individuals. It can be concluded that what one individual selectionist regards as adaptability may not be perfect in the eyes of another group selectionist.<br><strong>Errors caused by unpredictability or “malice” of the environment</strong><br>No matter how well an animal adapts to the environment, these environmental conditions must also be regarded as a statistical average. It is usually impossible for us to deal with every conceivable accident in detail, so any given animal will often be observed to make a “mistake” - easily fatal. This is not the same as the time lag problem already mentioned. The time lag problem arises because of the uncertainty of environmental statistics: the current average conditions are different from those experienced by the ancestors of animals. The problem here is even more inevitable. Modern animals may live under the average conditions consistent with their ancestors, but the possible events in the environment they face are also different every day. These situations are too complex to make accurate prediction.<br>Such cases always make us wonder why these organisms still obey these manipulations against their best interests on the time scale of evolution? Why doesn’t selection simply erase the Robin’s vulnerability to cuckoo deception? I believe that such problems and many other problems will one day become the basis for a new branch of Biology - the science of manipulation, arms race, and phenotype.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 13 gene extension<br>There is a disturbing contradiction at the core of selfish gene theory, which exists between genes and the carrier of life - life. On the one hand, we have got a beautiful story: independent DNA replication factors are as flexible as antelopes. They are freely handed down from generation to generation, temporarily combined in disposable biological containers, and the immortal double helix is constantly reorganized and inherited, honed when forming a decaying body, and finally move towards their own eternity. On the other hand, if we only observe the individual life itself, every life is a self-contained instrument, which is perfect, complex and precise, but unified and closely organized. Life is not just a product of a loose and temporary combination of genes. When sperm and eggs are about to start a new gene mixing process, these “Warring” gene vectors do not just know each other. With a dedicated brain, life coordinates the cooperation between limbs and sensory organs to complete various biological purposes. As a carrier, its work has reached the acme.<br>I think the most important question for any parasite is whether it transmits its genes to its offspring in the same way as the host’s genes. If not, I think it damages the host in various ways. But if they are the same, what a parasite can do is help its host survive and reproduce. With the progress of evolution, it will no longer be a parasite, but will cooperate with the host, and even eventually integrate into the host tissue. It is completely unable to identify it as a parasite. As I mentioned in Chapter 10, our cells have gone through this evolutionary process. We are actually the relics of all ancient parasitic biosynthesis.<br>Again, the main point here is: the genes of parasitic organisms need to pursue a common destiny and enjoy common interests with the host genes, so that parasitic organisms will eventually stop parasitic behavior.<br>One way to remind us is that even today, the phenotypic effects of not all genes are limited to the individual organisms in which they are located. In theory and in practice, genes cross the boundaries of individual organisms and manipulate objects in the external world, including inanimate things, living organisms and distant things. With a little imagination, we can see that genes sit in the center of the extended phenotypic radiation network. Any object in the world is at the node of this influence network, which comes from many genes in many organisms. There is no obvious boundary between the coverage of genes. The whole world is a cross, a causal arrow pointing to phenotypic effects by aggregated genes, either far or near.<br>There is another phenomenon: these crosses are gradually gathering. In fact, this phenomenon is very important and difficult to be ignored as an incidental phenomenon, but it is not enough to have a thorough foothold in theory. Replication factors no longer roam freely in the ocean, but gather into a huge group - individual organisms. Phenotypic changes are no longer evenly distributed in practice, and in many cases aggregate in the same body. We are familiar with the individual creatures on earth, but none of them ever existed on earth. No matter where in the universe, the only thing life needs is immortal replication factors.<br>Chapter 14 gene determinism and gene selection theory<br>What did genes do to have such an evil and irresistible reputation? Why don’t we demonize nursery education or confirmation courses into similar monsters? Why is it that only genes are considered more certain and irresistible than television, nuns or books? Ladies, don’t blame your husband for going out and fooling around. It’s not their fault to be stimulated by pornographic culture! The so-called Jesuits often boast, “give me your child’s first seven years and I’ll give you a man back.” That may make sense. Under certain conditions, the influence of education or other cultures may be as unalterable and irreversible as the influence of genes, and more people believe that “stars” have such influence.<br>I suspect that the reason why genes have become the monster of determinism is partly due to the confusion caused by a well-known fact, that is, the non heritability of learned characteristics. Before this century, it was widely believed that a person’s life experience and other knowledge gains could be imprinted on genetic material in some way and passed on to children. Later, people abandoned this cognition and replaced it with Weisman’s theory of germplasm continuity and its corresponding theory “central law” at the molecular level, which is one of the great achievements of modern biology. If we are in the inference of the orthodox theory of Weismann genetic school, genes do seem to be immutable and irresistible. They have been handed down from generation to generation, affecting the body that can’t escape death from generation to generation in form and behavior. However, apart from those rare nonspecific mutation effects, genes are never affected by the environment in which the body’s experience lives (in terms of genes, this view is correct). However, the chemical modification of genes and histones also leads to the existence of epigenetic phenomena, and the heritable expression of genetic information will be affected by environmental factors. Epigenetics is the most advanced genetic research in the past 20 years, so it is impossible for the author to understand it when writing this book). The genes in my body come from my four grandparents. These genes flow directly from them through my parents and reach me. What my parents have acquired, acquired, learned or experienced will not have any impact on the gene itself when these genes flow through them. On this point, there may be some evil. However, no matter how unchangeable and unshakable these genes are from generation to generation, the shape of the phenotype shown in the body they flow through is not unchangeable and unshakable at all. If I am a homozygous of gene G, nothing can stop me from passing gene G to all my children except mutation. But there are so many things that cannot be changed. As for whether I, or my children, can show the phenotypic characteristics generally associated with having gene G, it often depends more on how we were raised, what kind of food we ate, what kind of education we experienced, and what other genes we happen to have. Therefore, among the two major effects of genes - making more copies of themselves and affecting phenotypes - the first effect is indeed not easy to change (if rare mutations are aside), while the other effect is highly variable. I think the confusion between evolution and development is also partly responsible for the myth of genetic determinism.<br>Most of this chapter is based on the assumption that a biologist may want to infer the “function” of a behavior pattern within the framework of Darwinism. This does not mean that all behavior patterns must have a Darwinian function. There may be a large class of behavior patterns that are neutral or even harmful to individual organisms in selection, and can not be regarded as the product of natural selection. If this is the case, the discussion in this chapter does not apply to them. However, one expression is very reasonable: “I am very interested in adaptability. I don’t have to think of all behavior patterns as adaptability, but I want to study those behavior patterns that are adaptive. “ Similarly, the expression prefers to study vertebrates rather than invertebrates does not mean that we believe that all animals are vertebrates. Considering that the field of interest is adaptive behavior, when we talk about the Darwinian evolution of the object of interest, it is impossible not to assume a genetic basis in advance. Using “gene for X” as a concise way to talk about “gene basis needed to realize X” is a standard operation of population genetics for more than half a century.</p>

            <p>Describe an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p> In 2020, shortly after my IGCE exams, teachers and parents cooperated to organize a professional experience in the workplace, which let my classmates and I find our interests in future careers such as banking, network technology researcher, medicine and learn more about the work content in detail.</p>
<p>There were eight choices and these included Agricultural Bank of China, Network Technology Company, work experience in a dental hospital and so on. I was interested in a job related to biology and health, moreover I dreamt of becoming a doctor, so I chose the dental hospital placement.</p>
<p>Dentists use a lot of new technology and one area we studied was digital scanning which is used for oral modeling. The scanner transmitted the real-time oral image to the computer which automatically generated the tooth model immediately. As the dentist manipulated the scanner in her hand, she adjusted the image on the computer to make it complete. I realized that nowadays, almost every job uses computer technology which is something I learnt on this work placement. Then, training was given in plaque staining and scientific brushing. After rinsing with water, red edible dye showed teeth with soft debris. When the leading dentist worked with a student to give a demonstration of how to brush teeth in the right way, she did every step carefully in order to avoid any mistakes and was very thorough in her instructions which was helpful for learning quickly. Compared with doing surgical operations, this is simpler and less stressful. A dentist needs to communicate with his patients patiently to make sure everything goes well. I discovered that a clear mind is also very important for most activities in life! Additionally, a calm mind can ensure that timely remedial measures will quickly come to mind and avoid irreparable consequences, such as sequelae of the patient.</p>
<p>I benefited a lot from this visit and discovered that I am suitable for this kind of work which requires patience and care. Furthermore, I need to put more effort into the study of computer programming since it appears to be very important in this field.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                        SHEN ZIYOU</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 11 finding mother: new replication factors<br>But do we have to go to the distant universe to find other kinds of replication factors and other kinds of subsequent evolutionary phenomena? I think a new type of replication factor has recently appeared on our planet. It was right in front of us, but it was still in its infancy and awkwardly drifting in its original soup. But it is driving the process of evolution, and the speed is beyond the reach of the original factors.<br>This new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for this new replication factor. The name should be able to express the concept of a cultural communication unit or imitation unit“ The word “mimeme” comes from a proper Greek root, but I want a monosyllabic word that sounds a bit like “gene”. If I shorten the word “mimeme” to meme, I hope my classical friends will forgive me more. We can think that memory is related to memory or French m ê me, if it can make some people feel a little comfort. This word should rhyme with “cream”.<br>As my colleague N.K. Humphrey pointed out brilliantly when he summarized the content of the first draft of this chapter: “finding a mother should be regarded as a viable structure, which is not only a metaphor, but also academic. When you transplant a viable mother seeking into my heart, in fact, you turn my brain into the mother seeking host and make it a tool to spread the mother seeking, just like the genetic mechanism of a virus parasitic on a host cell. This is not just out of thin air. For example, the mother of “spiritual belief after death” can actually become material. As a structure in the nervous system of people all over the world, it obtains material power millions of times. “<br>Let’s study the concept of “God”. We don’t know how it was first produced in the mother seeking library. It probably appeared after many independent “mutation” processes. Anyway, the concept of “God” is really very old. How does it replicate itself? It is reproduced and spread through oral words and written words with the help of great music and great art. Why does it have such high survival value? You should remember that the “survival value” here does not mean the value of genes in the gene pool, but the value of looking for mothers in the mother pool. The real meaning of this question is what gives the stability and permeability of the concept of “God” in the cultural environment. The survival value of God’s mother seeking library comes from its strong psychological appeal“ The concept of “God” provides a seemingly plausible answer to some profound and distressing questions about survival. It implies that all kinds of unfairness in this world can be corrected in the afterlife. God stretched out his “eternal arms” to bear our human defects, just like a placebo prescribed by doctors for patients, which will also produce certain effects due to spiritual effects. This is part of the reason why God is accepted by people and copied and spread in people’s minds from generation to generation. We can say that in the environment provided by human culture, the image of God exists in the form of mother seeking with high survival value or appeal.<br>Broadly speaking, mother seeking replicates herself by imitation. But just as not all genes that can replicate themselves are good at self replication, some mothers in the mother searching library can achieve greater success than others. This process is similar to natural selection. I have listed some characteristics that help to improve the survival value of mother seeking. But generally speaking, these characteristics must be the same as those of replication factors mentioned in Chapter 2: longevity, fecundity and precise replication ability. Relatively speaking, it may not be important whether any mother seeking copy can live long, which is the same for a gene copy.<br>We need not seek the general biological survival value of various characteristics such as religion, music and sacrificial dance, although these values may also exist. Once a gene provides its survival machine with a brain capable of rapid imitation, the mother will automatically take over. We don’t even have to assume that imitation has some genetic superiority, although it will certainly bring convenience. The essential condition is that the brain should be able to imitate: then there will be a mother seeking to make full use of this ability.<br>Human beings may also have an extraordinary feature - the ability to show sincere and selfless altruistic behavior. I only wish so, but I am not going to debate this in any form, nor do I intend to speculate whether this feature can be attributed to the evolution of mother seeking. What I want to explain is that even if we focus on the dark side and assume that people are basically selfish, our conscious foresight - the ability to simulate the future in imagination - can prevent ourselves from conniving at blind replication factors to do the worst and excessive selfish acts. We have at least the spiritual strength to take care of our long-term selfish interests, not just short-term selfish interests. We can see the long-term benefits of participating in the “pigeon group”, and we can sit down and discuss ways to make the group successful. We have enough strength to resist our innate selfish genes. When necessary, we can also resist the selfish mother seeking instilled in our minds. We can even discuss how to carefully cultivate pure and selfless altruism, which has no place in nature and is unprecedented in the whole world history. We are built as genetic machines and trained as mother seeking machines, but we have enough strength to oppose our founders. In this world, only we, human beings, can resist the tyranny of selfish replication factors.<br>Chapter 12 a good man is rewarded<br>No one would think of bacteria as a conscious strategist, but parasitic bacteria seamlessly interact with their hosts in a prisoner’s dilemma. There is no reason not to use Axelrod’s Theory - kindness, tolerance, no jealousy, etc. to study their strategies. Axelrod and Hamilton pointed out that harmless and beneficial bacteria can become harmful or even fatal sepsis when people are injured. Doctors will say that the body’s “natural resistance” will decline when injured. But perhaps the real reason is the game of prisoner’s dilemma. In the human body, do bacteria gain and constantly test their returns? In the game between human body and bacteria, the “shadow of the future” is usually very long, because an ordinary person can live for many years at any starting point. However, a seriously injured person may bring a short future to its parasitic bacteria“ The temptation of betrayal is suddenly more attractive than the reward of mutual cooperation. Of course, bacteria don’t count these things in their evil little heads! The natural selection of generations of bacteria has cultivated them into an unconscious organism. The primary task is to maintain life by biochemistry.<br>Vampire bats are mysterious. For fans of Victorian Gothic novels, they are often dark forces that intimidate others at night, suck blood and sacrifice innocent lives to meet their selfish desires. In addition, other Victorian mysterious events and bats’ naturally bright red teeth and claws, aren’t blood sucking ghost bats the embodiment of the most frightening power of nature’s selfish genes? I scoff at these mysterious events. If we want to know the truth behind an event, we need to study it. What Darwinism gives us is not a detailed description of a particular creature, but a more subtle but valuable tool: the understanding of principles. If we must add a mysterious event, it is the truth - the story of the noble character of vampire bats. For bats themselves, blood is not thicker than water. They transcend kinship and form their long-term and solid ties among loyal friends. Vampire bats can tell a new mystery story, a story about sharing, mutual assistance and cooperation. They show this kind thought: even if we are all at the helm of selfish genes, good people will be rewarded.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 9  Gender war<br>Therefore, we can see that there are two opposite sexual “strategies” evolving. One is a massive investment or “honest” strategy. This strategy naturally opens the way for small investment, exploitative or “cunning” strategies. Once the two strategies start to run away from each other, it will continue like a runaway horse. Intermediates between these two volumes are punished because they do not have the advantages of either of these two extreme strategies. Cunning gametes become smaller and smaller, more and more flexible. Honest gametes have evolved larger and larger to compensate for the shrinking investment of cunning gametes, and become inflexible. Anyway, cunning gametes will always actively pursue them. Each honest gamete “would rather” fuse with another honest gamete, but the pressure of natural selection to repel cunning gametes is weaker than the pressure to drive them to exploit loopholes: because cunning gametes must win in this evolutionary battle, otherwise they will lose a lot. So honest gametes become eggs, and cunning gametes become sperm.<br>For simplicity, I illustrate the problem with the swing of the pendulum. In fact, the pendulum will never swing so much in the direction in which the female is absolutely dominant. Because once the sex ratio is unbalanced, the natural selection pressure of having a son will begin to push the pendulum back. The strategy of having the same number of children is an evolutionary stability strategy, that is, all genes that deviate from this strategy will suffer a net loss.<br>Chapter 10  If you scratch me, I’ll ride on your head<br>From the point of view of our current topic, slavery has had an interesting consequence. In the species that capture slaves, the queen can make the sexual proportion develop in the direction of its “like”. This is because its own children, that is, the ants who catch slaves, no longer have the real power to manage the nursery, which is now in the hands of slaves. These slaves “thought” that they were taking care of their own flesh and blood brothers or sisters. What they did was almost the same as what they had to do in their own cave, so as to achieve the 3:1 ratio in favor of sisters they hoped to achieve. But the queen, who specializes in the species of slave captivity, can take various countermeasures and successfully reverse this trend. Natural selection acting on slaves cannot counteract these countermeasures because they are not related to the larvae.<br>Human beings have developed good long-term memory and individual recognition ability. Therefore, we can expect altruism to play an important role in human evolution. Trivers goes further. He implies that human psychological characteristics such as jealousy, guilt, gratitude and compassion are formed through natural selection in order to improve the ability of deception, anti deception and avoiding being regarded as a liar. What is particularly interesting is that there is a kind of cunning liar. They seem to be mutually beneficial and altruistic, but they always get more and pay less. The characteristics of human swollen brain and good at rational calculation may even evolve with more and more sophisticated deception and more powerful anti deception mechanism.<br>When we apply the concept of reciprocal altruistic behavior to our own species, we can make endless and intriguing speculation about the possible consequences of this concept. Although I also want to talk about my own views, my imagination is no better than yours. Let readers entertain themselves!</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 7 Family Planning<br>If the mixed strategies of raising and bearing can adapt to the specific ecological conditions of species, they can be evolutionarily stable. A simple upbringing policy cannot be evolutionarily stable. If all individuals devote all their energy to raising existing young children, so that even a new individual does not produce, such a population will soon be invaded by mutant individuals skilled in fertility. Parenting can achieve evolutionary stability only as part of a hybrid strategy - at least a certain amount of reproductive activity is required.<br>According to this chapter, we come to the conclusion that the parents implement family planning in order to keep their birth rate at the most appropriate value. They try to keep their children alive as much as possible, which means they can’t have too many or too few children. Genes that allow individuals to have too many offspring are difficult to survive in the gene pool for a long time, because offspring carrying such genes are difficult to survive to adulthood.<br>Chapter 8 Intergenerational war<br>Parental investment is defined as “any form of investment made by the parent to the individual of the offspring, which increases the opportunity for the individual to survive (and thus successfully reproduce), but at the expense of the parent’s ability to invest in other individuals of the offspring.”<br>We compare animals to survival machines. Their behavior seems to have a “purpose” to preserve their own genes. In this way, we can talk about the contradiction between parents and offspring, that is, the struggle between the two generations. This is a delicate struggle. Both sides go all out and are not bound by any rules and regulations. Children use every opportunity to cheat. It will pretend to be more hungry than it really is, perhaps younger than it really is or facing greater danger than it really is. Although children are young and weak and unable to bully their parents, they do not hesitate to use all available psychological and tactical weapons - lying, cajoling, deceiving, using, and even abusing their kinship to act against their relatives. On the other hand, parents must be alert to such deception and try their best to avoid being deceived. It doesn’t seem difficult to do this.<br>What is discussed in this chapter and in the following chapter (we will discuss conflicts between spouses) seems to be a bit of a terrible irony. As human beings, parents treat each other sincerely and care for their children so meticulously. Therefore, these two chapters may even bring unspeakable pain to parents all over the world. Here, I must state once again that everything I say does not involve conscious motivation. No one believes that children deliberately and consciously deceive their parents because they have selfish genes. At the same time, I must reiterate that when I say “a child should take every opportunity to deceive… Lie, cheat, use…”, my so-called “should” has a special meaning. I don’t think such behavior is ethical and desirable. I just want to explain that natural selection is often beneficial to young children who show this behavior. Therefore, when we observe wild populations, we should not be surprised to see deception and selfish behavior among family members“ The expression “children should cheat” means that the genes that promote children to cheat are in a dominant position in the gene pool. If there is any profound implication for human beings to learn from, it is that we must instill the virtue of altruism into the minds of our children, because we can’t expect altruism in their nature.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 5 aggressive behavior: stable and selfish machines<br>Most members of the population adopt a certain strategy, and the benefits of this strategy are inferior to other strategies. This strategy is evolutionary stability strategy or ess. This concept is both subtle and important. In other words, for individuals, the best strategy depends on what most members of the population are doing. Since the rest of the population is also composed of individuals, and they all try to maximize their achievements, what can persist must be a strategy: once it is formed, the strategy of any individual with abnormal behavior can not be compared with it. After a big change in the environment, there may be a short stage of evolutionary instability in the population, or even fluctuations. But once an ESS is established, it will stabilize: deviation from ess will be punished by natural selection.<br>At first glance, this situation sounds a bit like group selection, but it has nothing in common with group selection. The reason why this situation sounds like group selection is that it reminds us of a population in a stable equilibrium. Whenever this equilibrium is broken, the population can often gradually return to this equilibrium. However, ESS is a far more subtle concept than group selection. It has nothing to do with the fact that some groups are more successful than others.<br>Chapter 6 Genetic race<br>When we calculate the kinship index, we need to further adjust the concise symmetric calculus. In terms of genetics, grandparents and grandchildren treat each other with altruistic behavior for the same reason, because a quarter of their genes are common. However, if the life expectancy of grandchildren is longer, the genes that manipulate the altruistic behavior of grandparents have better selection conditions than the genes that manipulate the altruistic behavior of grandchildren to grandparents. The net benefit from assisting a young distant relative is likely to exceed the net benefit from assisting an old close relative (by the way, the life expectancy of grandparents is certainly not necessarily shorter than that of grandchildren). In species with high infant mortality, the opposite may be true).<br>If we want to program a computer to simulate how a typical survival machine makes decisions about whether to behave altruistic behavior, we should probably do this: make a list of all the behaviors that the animal may do, and then program a weighted calculus for each mode of these behaviors. All kinds of interests are given a positive sign and all kinds of risks are given a negative sign. Then it is weighted, that is, each benefit and risk are multiplied by an appropriate index indicating kinship. Then add up the figures. For the convenience of calculation, we don’t consider the weights of other aspects such as age and health status at the beginning. Since an individual’s kinship index to himself is 1 (that is, he has 100% of his own genes - it is self-evident), there is no need to discount all his risks and interests, that is, give full weight in the calculation. In this way, the sum of each possible behavior pattern is roughly as follows: the net benefit of the behavior pattern = benefit to oneself - risk to oneself + 1 / 2 benefit to Brothers - 1 / 2 risk to brothers + 1 / 2 benefit to another brother - 1 / 2 risk to another brother + 1 / 8 benefit to cousins - 1 / 8 risk to cousins + 1 / 2 benefit to children - 1 / 2 risk to children +<br>We can therefore conclude that in terms of the evolution of altruistic behavior, the importance of “real” kinship may not be as important as animals can estimate kinship. To understand this fact, we can understand why parental love is much more common and sincere than altruistic behavior between brothers / sisters in nature, and why its own interests are even more important to animals than several brothers. In short, I mean, in addition to the kinship index, we should also consider the “certainty” index. Although the parent / child relationship is not closer than the brother / sister relationship in the sense of genetics, it is much more positive. In general, it is not as easy to be sure who is your brother as to be sure who is your child. As for who you are, it’s easier to be sure.<br>There is another asymmetry in parent-child relationships, which does not apply to brother / sister relationships. Children are always younger than their parents, which often, if not forever, means that children have a longer life expectancy. As I emphasized above, life expectancy is an important variable. In the most ideal environment, an animal should consider this variable in “calculus” to “decide” whether it needs to show altruistic behavior. In species where children’s average life expectancy is longer than that of their parents, any gene that manipulates children’s altruistic behavior will be at a disadvantage, because the beneficiaries of altruistic self sacrifice manipulated by these genes are older and nearer the age of the altruists themselves. On the other hand, in terms of life expectancy in the equation, the genes that manipulate parental altruistic behavior are in a relatively favorable position.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Chapter 3 the immortal double helix<br>A DNA molecule is a long chain of building blocks called nucleotides. Just as protein molecules are amino acid chains, DNA molecules are nucleotide chains. DNA is too small to be seen by the naked eye, but its exact shape has been cleverly revealed by human indirectly. It is composed of a pair of nucleotide chains. The two chains interweave each other in an elegant spiral shape, which is called “double helix” or “immortal helix”. There are only four kinds of nucleotide components, which can be referred to as a, t, C and G for short. In all animals and plants, the four are the same, but the difference is the order in which they intertwine.<br>Another aspect of gene graininess is that it does not age, and even a gene that has lived for one million years is not more likely to die than a partner that has only lived for 100 years. It transfers from one individual to another generation by generation, and controls one individual after another in its own way to achieve its own goal; It abandons dying individuals before they fall into aging and death.<br>Chapter 4 gene machine<br>Like Andromeda, genes can only do their best to deploy everything in advance, build a fast-moving computer for themselves, make them master the laws of as many situations as genes can “expect”, and give “advice” for this. But life is as unpredictable as chess. It is unrealistic to foresee everything in advance. Like the programmers of chess games, the “instructions” of genes to the survival machine can not be specific and subtle, it can only be the general strategy and various tips for livelihood.<br>In a complex world, there are certain risks in making predictions about the future., Every decision of the survival machine is a gambling behavior. Genes have the responsibility to program the brain in advance so that the decisions made by the brain can achieve positive results. In the evolutionary casino, the chip is survival, strictly speaking, the survival of genes. But in order to be reasonable, the general similar statement can also be individual survival.<br>Every time a contact system comes into being, there is always a risk that some creatures will use the system for their own benefit. Because we have been influenced by the evolutionary view of “species interests”, we naturally think that liars and cheaters belong to different species: predators, prey animals, parasites and so on. However, when there is a conflict of interests between different individuals’ genes, it is inevitable that there will be such behaviors as lying, cheating and selfish communication. This includes different individuals belonging to the same species. We will see that even children cheat their parents, husbands cheat their wives, and brothers cheat each other.<br>Some people believe that animal contact signals were originally developed for mutual benefit, but later used by bad elements. After all, this idea is too naive. The actual situation is likely to be: from the beginning, all animal contact behaviors are mixed with some kind of fraud, because all animals have to involve at least some kind of conflict of interest when they interact with each other.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p>Text<br>Chapter 1 Why would anyone?<br>It is of course beneficial for me to use the method of reduction to absurdity to demonstrate and reveal the dilemma that the theory of group selection can not justify itself, but the obvious altruistic behavior of individuals still needs to be explained.<br>My belief is deeply influenced by Williams’ great book adaptation and natural selection. The central point I want to use can be traced back to the late 19th century and the early 20th century, when Weisman’s “continuity of the germplasms” theory predicted today’s development. The basic unit of choice that I will demonstrate, that is, the basic unit of self-interest, is neither species nor group, nor even individual, strictly speaking, but genetic unit gene.<br>Chapter 2 Replicator<br>The hemoglobin in our blood is a typical protein molecule. It consists of smaller molecules, chains of amino acids, each containing dozens of atoms arranged precisely. There are 574 amino acid molecules in the hemoglobin molecule, which are arranged into four intertwined chains to form a solid sphere. The complexity of its structure is really dazzling. A model of hemoglobin molecule looks like a dense Tribulus terrestris, but it is different from a real Tribulus terrestris. It is not a random approximate model, but a fixed structure. This structure is repeated more than 60 trillion times in the human body, and its structure is exactly the same. Hemoglobin, a protein molecule like Tribulus terrestris, is stable in shape. That is to say, its two pairs of chains composed of amino acids with the same sequence tend to form exactly the same three-dimensional coiled structure like two springs. In the human body, hemoglobin tribulus forms their “favorite” shape at the rate of about 400 trillion per second, while other hemoglobin is destroyed at the same rate.<br>Today, they live together in groups, live in the giant “robot” body, separate from the outside world, connect with the outside world through indirect circuitous ways, and control the outside world through remote control. They exist in you and me, they create us, they create our bodies and minds, and preserving them is the ultimate reason for our existence. These replicators have a long history. Today, we call them genes, and we are their survival machines.</p>

            <p>The Selfish Gene</p>
<p><em>Catalogue</em><br>Chapter 1 Why are there people?<br>Curious children often ask, “Why are there people?” Darwin enabled us to give a practical answer to this question. Is life meaningful? What is the purpose of life? What is human? In the face of these profound problems, we no longer need to turn to the supernatural.<br>Chapter 2 replication factors<br>They exist in you and me, they create us, they create our bodies and minds, and preserving them is the ultimate reason for our existence. These replicators have a long history. Today, we call them genes, and we are their survival machines.<br>Chapter 3 the immortal double helix<br>DNA is too small to be seen by the naked eye, but its exact shape has been cleverly revealed by human indirectly. It is composed of a pair of nucleotide chains. The two chains interweave with each other in an elegant spiral shape, which is called “double helix” or “immortal helix”.<br>Chapter 4 gene machine<br>Polar bear genes can be sure to know in advance that their unborn survival machine will face a cold environment. This prediction is not the result of genetic thinking. They don’t think: they’re just prepping a thick coat of fur, because in some previous bodies, they always did.<br>Chapter 5 aggressive behavior: the machine of stability and selfishness<br>For the survival machine, the logical strategy seems to be to kill its competitors and then better eat them. Although massacre and cannibalism occur in nature, it is a naive understanding of selfish gene theory that this phenomenon is widespread.<br>Chapter 6 gene race<br>According to Hamilton’s theory of heredity, we can easily explain the feud between clans and the fight between families. Incest taboo shows that human beings have a deep sense of kinship, although the genetic benefits of incest taboo have nothing to do with altruism. It is probably related to the harmful effects of recessive genes produced by inbreeding.<br>Chapter 7 family planning<br>The reason why individuals regulate the number of eggs in their nests is not the motivation of altruism. They will not implement birth control in order to avoid excessive consumption of group resources. Their goal of birth control is to maximize the survival of their existing children, which runs counter to our original goal of birth control.<br>Chapter 8 the battle of generations<br>It’s a delicate fight, with both sides going all out and not bound by any rules. Children use every opportunity to cheat. It will pretend to be more hungry than it is, maybe younger than it is, or face greater danger than it is. On the other hand, parents should be alert to such deception and try their best to avoid being cheated.<br>Chapter 9 gender war<br>In view of the fact that sperm is easy to lose, male fish must wait until the female spawns before ejaculating on the egg. But in this way, the female fish has a rare few seconds to slip away and leave the fertilized eggs in the care of the male fish, putting them in what trevors calls a dilemma.<br>Chapter 10 you itch for me, I’ll ride on your head<br>Suppose B has a parasite on its head, and a removes it. Soon after, a had parasites on his head. Of course, a went to B, hoping that B would get rid of them in return. As a result, B sniffed and turned around. B is a swindler. This swindler accepts the favor of others, but he is not grateful.<br>Chapter 11 finding the mother: a new replicator<br>I think a new type of replicator has recently emerged on our planet. It’s right in front of us, but it’s still in its infancy, still clumsily drifting in its original soup. But it’s pushing the evolutionary process so fast that the original factor is out of reach. This new soup is the soup of human culture.<br>Chapter 12 a good man is rewarded<br>The number of good people is doomed to decrease, and goodness will eventually perish in Darwinism. There is another special explanation for “good man” here, which is not far from the meaning in the common saying. But in this kind of explanation, good people can “get what they want.”.<br>Chapter 13 gene extension<br>We can further infer that genes in one organism can have extended phenotypic effects on another. Genes escape from their own bodies and manipulate the outside world.<br>Chapter 14 gene determinism and gene selection<br>For centuries, philosophers and theologians have been debating whether determinism is correct and whether it is related to a person’s moral responsibility for his own actions.<br>Chapter 15 restriction on Perfection<br>The animals we see today may be “out of date”, and the genes that affect the establishment process were selected at an earlier time to cope with different conditions.</p>
